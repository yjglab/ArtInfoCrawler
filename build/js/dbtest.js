This intriguing new display highlights over 50 works engraved on wood by the Brothers Dalziel firm, illustrating literary and commercial work published throughout the Victorian period. In 1913 the British Museum acquired the firm's entire company archive of 54,000 proof wood engravings, now catalogued as part of the Dalziel Project(Opens in new window) in partnership with the University of Sussex. It investigates the vast body of visual art produced by the Brothers Dalziel for everything from popular novels to commercial adverts, global exhibitions and journalism. Wood engraving revolutionised the mass production of images in the Victorian era. Established in 1839, the Brothers Dalziel (one of whom was a sister – Margaret – a talented senior engraver) became the most successful wood-engraving company in Britain, employing dozens of engravers. The Brothers Dalziel had enormous cultural power in Victorian Britain, shaping the way people visualised art, goods and ideas. Mostly the engravers made images after designs by draughtspeople, including major artists such as Frederic Leighton and John Everett Millais, and it's these artists who were widely credited and remembered. However, the process was collaborative and the skill of the 'peckers' was considerable.",

The exhibition includes artists who have lived, studied or worked in the UK. Several artists show how drawing, often considered a quiet or private medium, can be used to protest injustice. Catherine Anyango Grünewald has described the time and labour invested in her monumental drawings as a 'direct homage' to their subjects, often the victims of institutional crimes, while the painstaking detail of Irish artist Miriam de Búrca's drawings of clods of earth from cilliní – the unmarked graves of those deemed unfit for Christian burial – force us to confront an uncomfortable history. Over 20 new acquisitions will be shown for the first time alongside some of the most celebrated works from the Museum's collection by the likes of Andy Warhol, Käthe Kollwitz, Odilon Redon, Mary Delany and Michelangelo, demonstrating their continuities with the existing collection, and their relationships to historical traditions of drawing. These artists include some of the youngest ever collected by the Museum during their lifetime, and represent some of the most exciting up-and-coming names in the field of contemporary drawing.

    detail: "'Lesser artists borrow; great artists steal.' Pablo Picasso For the first time, Picasso’s ‘Woman with a Book’ (1932) from the Norton Simon Museum, California, will be brought together with the painting that inspired it, ‘Madame Moitessier’ by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Picasso first encountered the enigmatic ‘Madame Moitessier’ at an exhibition in Paris, in 1921, and was enthralled. Over the next decade, he repeatedly referenced Ingres in his art, and painted ‘Woman with a Book’, one of his most celebrated portraits, in homage to Ingres’s famous work. For Ingres, a 19th-century French artist steeped in the academic tradition, the beautiful and wealthy Madame Moitessier represented the classical ideal. Wearing her finest clothes and jewellery, she gazes at the viewer majestically, the embodiment of luxury and style during the Second Empire. Picasso, born 100 years after Ingres, is famous for a very different, abstract, style of art, but his inspiration is clear. The model for ‘Woman with a Book’, Picasso's then young mistress, Marie-Thérèse Walter, mimics Madame Moitessier’s distinct pose. The painting balances sensuality and restraint, striking a chord with the eroticism latent beneath Ingres’s image of bourgeois respectability. ‘Picasso Ingres: Face to Face’ is a unique opportunity to see these two portraits, side by side, for the first time, and to trace the continuous thread between 19th and 20th-century artistic development.

    detail: "For the first time in the UK, we present an overview of Winslow Homer (1836–1910), the great American Realist painter who confronted the leading issues facing the United States, and its relationship with both Europe and the Caribbean world, in the final decades of the 19th century. Homer’s career spanned a turning point in North American history. He lived through the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery, so-called Reconstruction, and war with the last colonial European power in the Americas, Spain. From his sketches of battle and camp life, to dazzling tropical views and darker restless seascapes, the works reflect Homer’s interest in the pressing issues of his time; conflict, race, and the relationship between humankind and the environment – issues still relevant for us today. After the war, Homer’s subject became the lives of Americans in the wake of the war and abolition with a focus on the lives of formerly enslaved African Americans. Homer travelled to France, England, the Bahamas, Cuba and Bermuda. In England, he painted scenes of heroism and resilience that he saw while staying in Cullercoats, a town on the North East coast. In the Caribbean, his paintings became more vivid as he painted the transparent turquoise waters and lush vegetation. His interest in conflict remained constant and he often explored the issue through painting the life and struggles of Black people. With more than fifty paintings, covering over forty years of Homer’s career, 'Winslow Homer: Force of Nature' is part of a programme of exhibitions that introduce major American artists to a UK and European audience and follows on from our exhibitions about George Bellows and the Ashcan painters, Frederic Church and Thomas Cole.

    detail: "This first major exhibition of Lucian Freud’s work in 10 years brings together paintings from more than seven decades. The exhibition presents the paintings of one of Britain's most well-known figurative painters, Lucian Freud (1922–2011). It spans a lifetime of work, showing how Freud’s painting changed during 70 years of practice from his early and intimate works to his well-known, large-scale canvasses and his monumental naked portraits. Through more than 60 paintings, you will see the development of an artist: paintings of powerful public figures are followed by private studies of friends and family; the familiar, domestic setting gives way to the artist’s paint-splattered studio – a place that becomes both stage and a subject in its own right – and the approximated features of his earliest paintings are complemented by the expertly rendered flesh of his final works. Freud's celebrity often overshadowed the work he produced and the historical context in which they were made. Bringing to light new perspectives on a lifetime’s work, this exhibition looks beyond Freud's fame and infamy to focus on the artist's uncompromising commitment to painting in the 20th century.",

    detail: "In the 17th century, global commerce fueled the economy of the Netherlands and sparked an artistic boom. Dutch merchants sailed from Amsterdam and other ports across seas and oceans, joining trade networks that stretched from Asia to the Americas and Africa. This unprecedented movement of goods, ideas, and people, both free and enslaved, gave rise to what some have called the first age of globalization. Prosperous citizens commissioned and collected art in great volume and the artistic high points of this period continue to be deeply admired today. This suite of renovated galleries at the MFA employs up-to-date research to explore the nexus between art, commerce, and science in the Dutch Republic and Flanders. Nearly 100 paintings by the greatest masters—including Rembrandt van Rijn, Peter Paul Rubens, Gerrit Dou, Frans Hals, and Anthony van Dyck—plus works on paper and decorative arts such as silver and Delft ceramics represent this rich visual culture. Organized thematically, the installation examines a variety of subjects: women artists and patrons; the growth of a modern art market; and the unexpected connection between still life paintings, the sugar trade, and slavery. Among the many highlights are Rembrandt’s moving Portrait of Aeltje Uylenburgh (1632), a Dutch doll’s house filled with nearly 200 miniature furnishings, and an early self-portrait by Van Dyck posing as Icarus, painted when the artist was just 19 years old. The opening of the new galleries celebrates the launch of the Center for Netherlandish Art (CNA), an innovative center for scholarship housed at the MFA and the first resource of its kind in the US. The CNA was established with initial endowment funds from Rose-Marie and Eijk van Otterloo and Susan and Matthew Weatherbie, given as part of a landmark 2017 gift that also included many of the paintings on view in the installation. ​",

Together they span place and time, and explore different themes—from Native perspectives on the Southwest to ways artists reckoned with the traumas of World War II, from the knotty politics of Latin American realism to the vibrant links between art, design, and jazz. As in reading an anthology, visitors are invited to consider each space independently, or to think about the threads that weave together a larger whole. Many of the artists represented here devoted their lives and careers to resisting and reimagining conventions. Through their work, these galleries tell stories about boundaries crossed, borders challenged. Icons from the MFA’s collection appear alongside works by underrecognized artists, creating combinations, juxtapositions, and connections that make room for questions as well as possibilities. “Stories Artists Tell: Art of the Americas, the 20th Century” also gives context to a series of changing exhibitions in the central gallery (Gallery 332). The first, “Touching Roots: Black Ancestral Legacies in the Americas,” brings together work by Black artists who engaged with African artistic traditions, aesthetic expressions, and sacred practices.

    detail: "Africa is at once a point of origin and a myriad of associations—real and imagined—for many Black artists working in the Americas. In the 20th century, some artists self-consciously responded to writer and philosopher Alain LeRoy Locke’s call to engage with “those ancestral arts.” Others continued to practice African artistic traditions passed down through generations. This exhibition traces narratives of Blackness across the Atlantic world by bringing together work from artists who absorbed and reinterpreted African artistic practices, sacred customs, and cultural expressions. The artworks honor ancestral spirits and Black legacies through painting, sculpture, textiles, and dance. Artists from throughout the Americas are represented—with a special focus on those from or working in New England, like Allan Rohan Crite, Napoleon Jones-Henderson, Ifé Franklin, Bryan McFarlane, Karen Hampton, and Stephen Hamilton. Highlights from the collection include Ubi Girl from Tai Region (1972) by Loïs Mailou Jones, African Woman (about 1933) by James Richmond Barthé, Untitled (1943) by Wifredo Lam, and George Jackson (1971) by Kofi Bailey. Visitors can explore how shared cultural heritages created connections that formed the basis of communities, highlighting the importance of Africa’s presence in the Americas. By turning their gaze inward and toward Africa, Black artists grounded their artistic expressions and infused strength and insight into their work. This exhibition accompanies “Stories Artists Tell: Art of the Americas, the 20th Century,” a suite of galleries spanning place and time, and exploring different themes surrounding 20th-century art from the Americas. Outside scholars and collaborators have been essential in the conceptualization and planning of this exhibition.

    detail: "Through dreamlike woven tapestries, Texas-born artist Diedrick Brackens (b. 1989) explores African American and queer identity, his own life, and broader American history. He usually begins his colorful textiles by hand-dyeing cotton, a material that is cheap and ubiquitous, but for his “Banner Project” Brackens chose a different process. Working with Designtex on a commercial loom, Brackens foregrounds the fraught connections between hand and machine labor in the United States—specifically the cotton industry’s brutal reliance on enslaved people (including Brackens’s own forebears), who were forced to pick cotton by hand and enjoyed no profit when it was sent to the mills. The tapestry depicts catfish swimming in water among reeds, watched closely by a solitary figure. Catfish, which thrive in muddy riverbeds in the American South, are often derided as common. But Brackens sees them as a symbol of his geographic and cultural roots, and throughout his work he frames them as worthy of consideration “in the way that the tapestries of the Middle Ages exalted unicorns, lions, dragons, and stags.” Brackens’s banner responds to a tapestry in the MFA’s collection by John Henry Dearle (1860–1932), an artist who also looked back to the medieval period. As mechanization and factory production became more prevalent at the turn of the 20th century, Dearle and his peers from the British Arts and Crafts movement reacted to the perceived decline of art, craft, and even life itself by promoting the dignity of labor done by hand. Commissioned for this exhibition, Brackens’s banner asks visitors to consider the extensive textile history in New England, where mills proliferated, often built on violent labor conditions for those who picked and processed their raw materials. But the motif of the catfish refuses any singular reading, offering the artist a way to reflect on “sustenance, my ancestors, and myself; it functions as a spirit linking the living and dead.”",

    detail: "“Empowered Faces” is a mixed-media mural that showcases young artists’ self-portraits through abstracted forms. Artist and educator Perla Mabel collaborated with students from the Museum’s Community Arts Initiative partners in the Boston area on the project, teaching them to celebrate cultural identity and self-discovery in their art. The final layered installation documents the students’ creative processes, using collage and sewing to express how individual experiences come together to represent a diverse, collective community. Works from the Museum’s collection by Faith Ringgold, Ekua Holmes, and others complement the students’ self-portraits by demonstrating how personal narrative and introspection result in unique, multilayered works of art. The young artists studied these works as a key part of the learning process, empowering them to create their own personalized representations. The cumulative mural includes mirrored acrylic, encouraging visitors to see themselves as a welcome part of the narrative. “Empowered Faces” marks the 17th year of the Community Arts Initiative, through which the MFA partners with community organizations to introduce young people ages 6 to 12 to the Museum’s collection and the art-making process. For this exhibition, through the Community Arts Initiative, the Museum is proud to partner with the Berkshire Partners Blue Hill Boys & Girls Club, the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, the Charlestown Boys & Girls Club, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Dorchester, the Edgerley Family South Boston Boys & Girls Club, the Jordan Boys & Girls Club, the Orchard Gardens Boys & Girls Club, Sociedad Latina, United South End Settlements, the Vine Street Community Center, the West End House Boys & Girls Club of Allston-Brighton, and the Yawkey Boys & Girls Club of Roxbury.",

For this project, the Art Institute invited the collective to mine the museum’s photography collection as the starting point for a new site-specific installation—one that further connects the museum to the communities it serves and aims to assemble a new community in the galleries. Floating Museum, along with three curators in Photography and Media at the Art Institute—Grace Deveney, Elizabeth Siegel, and Matthew Witkovsky—extended invitations to 10 photographers and paired them with 10 local “hosts”—political leaders, activists, and arts supporters in the city. In a series of Zoom conversations, Floating Museum talked extensively with each host about their lives and experiences. Each host was asked to choose one of three photographs from the Art Institute’s collection, and a copy of that work was sent to the host to display in a place they had designated as “home.” Each photographer made a portrait of their host with their chosen work in that home setting. Finally, Floating Museum incorporated each new photograph into a lightbox sculpture further illuminated by domestic lighting. A Lion for Every House brings together all of these components in the Art Institute’s galleries: the 30 original photographs from the collection, including the 10 ultimately selected by each host; the new photographs taken of the hosts and their selected work; and the sculptural installation inspired by the entire process. The exhibition takes its title from Sonia Sanchez’s epic poem, Does Your House Have Lions? In Sanchez’s telling, lions stand in for the people and things that protect a family and a home; at the Art Institute, they famously guard the entrance to a vast repository of artworks held for public benefit. By creating a circuit in which copies of museum objects move to other homes, are reproduced and transformed in those settings, and then return to the galleries and inspire new work, the exhibition explores how the walls between institutional, civic, domestic, and community spaces can become more porous. It also invites us to consider the power of collective and collaborative work and to reflect on what it means for an institution and a community to be generous and accessible.",

Striking artifacts—displayed along one wall of the gallery in a series of innovative cases that promote viewing from multiple vantage points—provide insight into the beliefs and practices of this illustrious North African culture. Recurring themes throughout this fresh presentation of the collection consider the impact of Egypt’s natural environment, including the Nile River, on its visual culture; reveal the processes of ancient Egyptian artists; and explore the centrality of gods and goddesses to life (and death) along the Nile. Arresting sculptures, such as the statue of Shebenhor, reveal how ancient Egyptians chose to present themselves so that they would be remembered for eternity, while funerary works—such as a gilded funerary mask—unveil practices for preparing for and protecting oneself in the afterlife.",

    detail: "Does color have shape? What is the texture of scale? Is it possible to eliminate surface? Can space expand? For more than a decade, American designer Jonathan Muecke (born 1983) has tackled such deceptively straightforward yet puzzling questions about the relationship between form, material, and perception through a range of creative experiments. Whether working in steel, wood, textile, or composite materials, Muecke’s intent remains consistent: to produce objects that challenge our spatial expectations and habits, prompting us to experience our physical environments—and to understand our place within them—anew. Objects in Sculpture, the designer’s first solo exhibition in a major museum, presents a selection of key works that Muecke identifies as “open objects.” Harnessing precise, spare lines and evocative shapes, the objects eschew traditional design typologies and historical references. Each work rigorously questions the interdependence and possible synthesis of formal and material phenomena. The resulting objects are curious, enigmatic, but also familiar: a rock with holes; a faceted curvature of carbon fiber felt; a five-sided, open box made of steel; a textile volume with concave surfaces; a continuous, multitiered wooden zig-zag. Muecke insists that these ascetic objects—while meticulously crafted and deliberately devoid of details—are not minimal. Instead, he argues, the objects are “maximums,” each manifesting the limits of legibility and perception, memory and apprehension, and therefore have the capacity to generate new relationships between objects, bodies, and space.",

    detail: "The brilliant turquoise-blue is not a pigment but results from the way their transparent feathers refract light. By the Song dynasty (960–1278), portraits of empresses showed them wearing headdresses adorned with kingfisher ornaments. Few examples of this fragile artistry have survived, and the earliest ones come from the tomb of the Wanli Emperor (reigned 1572–1620), in which archaeologists found four elaborate kingfisher crowns worn by his empresses. The vivid feathers were expensive, with the most prized specimens imported from Cambodia and Vietnam. Artisans cut them to shape before painstakingly pasting the feathers onto gilded metal backing that formed the structure of the headdresses. Precious and semiprecious stones such as rubies, agate, and jadeite as well as other valuable materials including amber, coral, and pearls added to the splendid effect. Although the most sumptuous examples were worn by empresses and consorts, aristocratic and wealthy women also wore kingfisher crowns and jewelry on special occasions such as birthdays and weddings. Popular motifs—bats, butterflies, dragons, and phoenixes—symbolized various aspects of good fortune. This exhibition brings together over 20 objects crafted from these extraordinarily beautiful feathers, all promised gifts from Barbara and David Kipper. They include ornate headdresses as well as smaller pieces of jewelry and hairpins, which provided a less cumbersome touch of glamour.",

The Cincinnati Art Museum along with the Independent Curators International (ICI) invite our global digital community to create and collaborate with The Paper Sculpture Manual, a downloadable, printable, and shareable manual to take you away from your screens and recreate art experiences in domestic spaces. These shareable designs from The Paper Sculpture Show, a traveling exhibition in 2003-2007, feature three-dimensional paper sculptures designed by twenty-nine international artists and artist collaboratives that are meant to be assembled by you, the visitor. Don’t have access to a printer? That’s okay! We encourage participators to assemble their favorite pieces into paper sculptures using whatever readily accessible materials are at their disposal. Repurposing and transforming magazines, old newspapers, books, and cardboard boxes and containers is, in part, the ethos of this exhibition—bringing new meaning to an existing form, giving depth and dimension to a flat surface. The Paper Sculpture Show raises many questions: Who is the author of these three-dimensional objects, the artists who designed them, or the visitors who assemble them at home? Which is the original and which the copy? Instead of providing answers, The Paper Sculpture Show suggests flexible definitions of a work of art that accommodate the variety of creative practices that now constitute contemporary art and culture. Now the question is: what are YOU going to make? Create one or all twenty-nine. Be sure to tag us on social media using #papersculpturemanual, so we can follow along! Each paper sculpture measures 10 x 12 3/4 inches and will require no more than four sheets of paper, along with a limited set of tools including: scissors, tape, and glue for assembly. Stay tuned for more exciting content here and on our Facebook Group, CAM Connect, as we take a special look at our permanent collection through the expressive and dimensional medium of paper.",

    detail: "April 25, 2022 marks exactly 100 years since the organization of the first restoration workshop at the Russian Museum. Now it is the Department of the Restoration of Museum Treasures (Art Conversation Department) that deals with the preservation of exhibits in the Russian Museum. It consists of 15 different sections. These are 13 restoration departments, whose employees deal with almost all items stored in the museum, as well as 2 auxiliary departments: the Department of chemical and biological research and the Department of restoration activities coordination. Nowadays the restorers face several tasks at once. First of all, it is constant monitoring of the state of the art pieces on display as well as the control of the preservation state of museum objects (and there are more than 400,000 of them in the Russian Museum today). Secondly, it is the direct work on the restoration and conservation of museum items. For reference: in average, about 4,500 items pass through the restoration workshops during the year. Of these, about 300 items are exhibits that have undergone complex restoration. And the third task, no less important than the first two, is the maintenance of scientific documentation. This is the compilation of cartograms of conservation state descriptions, photographing objects before and in the process of restoration, maintaining restoration passports, protocols, transfer acts, reports, etc. Only 330 of the most interesting exhibits from the restoration point of view will be presented at the exhibition. These are paintings, icons and graphic works, objects of decorative, applied and folk art and sculptures. The presented exhibits are only a small part of the tens of thousands of items that have been restored in the Russian Museum over the past 100 years. About 30 works out of 330 will be exhibited at their permanent storage places in the museum halls. These are “The Last Day of Pompeii” by Karl Bryullov and “The Bronze Serpent” by Fyodor Bruni, as well as a number of masterpieces of ancient Russian painting, including one of the gems of the collection, the 14th-century icon “Boris and Gleb”.",

    detail: "Alexandre Roubtzoff (1884–1949) – a unique Russian artist who, by the will of fate, turned out to be the 'singer and chronicler' of Tunisia. Being a pensioner of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, from 1914 he lived and worked in Tunisia. The First World War made it impossible for him to return to Russia. The young artist settled in the suburbs of the capital of Tunisia, traveled around North Africa, repeatedly visited Algeria, Morocco. The land of great contrasts: with the sands of the Sahara and the snowy Atlas mountains; from the uninhabited expanses to the narrow city streets of the 'medina' – was where the skill of the landscape painter Alexandre Roubtzoff flourished. His name soon becomes known: his art works are getting published in magazines, he participates in exhibitions, receives commisions for portraits. This would be the only source of livelihood after 1917, when his ties with Russia would break. In French artistic circles in the 1920s, Roubtzoff, a native of St. Petersburg, gained fame for his art works, conveying the image of a wonderful world that captured him with its fabulousness, exoticism and colorfulness. Almost all of Roubtzoff 's creative life was spent in Tunisia. Most of the subjects are North African landscapes with their amazing lighting, Moorish folklore, Arab life and applied art. From time to time, Roubtzoff, who has taken French citizenship, traveled to Europe; almost every year he exhibited his works in France, and also repeatedly – in the capital of Morocco, Rabat. The artist was awarded the Order of the French Academy of Arts; and in Tunisia he took part in the creation of the Center for the Arts. Throughout his life, Roubtzoff was reluctant to sell his work, so that his extensive legacy has been well-preserved. The exhibition at the Russian Museum will feature more than 80 paintings and drawings of different years from the private collection of Mehdi Douss. The exposition will also include several works by Y. Zionglinsky, D. Kardovsky - the artist's academic teachers from the collection of the State Russian Museum.",

    thumbnailSrc: "https://www.kreml.ru/pi/c4m1/i50203/slaider.jpg",
    detail: "The exhibition, marking two important anniversaries – the 100th Anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the 150th Anniversary of the brilliant diplomat, the first People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the USSR, Georgy Vasilievich Chicherin – brings together over eighty unique objects, most of which are presented to the public for the first time. The central place in the display is given to historical rarities from the collection of Moscow Kremlin Museums – the Red Army uniforms and presents from foreign delegations, which belonged to the legendary commissar identified as such as a result of recent research. Memorial items, as well as documents and photographs provided by the leading Russian archives, phaleristics artifacts, remarkable samples of agitation porcelain with revolutionary slogans, paintings, graphics and artistic metal from the Russian museum collections, tell about the life and work of G.V. Chicherin and about the turbulent and controversial era in which he was entrusted to be the leader of the Soviet Foreign Office. On the 100th Anniversary of the USSR, it is worth remembering that G.V. Chicherin, who was a consistent advocate of the centralized model of foreign policy management, played a significant role in establishing the all-union People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. The letter of 1923 signed by Stalin – presented at the exhibition – makes a point of the direct and active participation of G.V. Chicherin in 'working out' the first USSR Constitution as well. It is for the first time when the Moscow Kremlin Museums will show sets of uniforms of 1922-1924 model belonging to G.V. Chicherin: two soldier blouses, galifé pants and a greatcoat with sew-on buckle strips on chest. The great value of these items is due both to their commemorative significance and almost perfect condition, for only a few genuine examples of the Red Army uniform of the early 1920s have survived to this day. During official receptions in the Kremlin, the military uniform became a worthy alternative to the tails, tuxedo and top hat, which were stipulated by the norms of international protocol, but in Soviet Russia were associated with a hostile 'bourgeoisie'. Another indispensable attribute without which contemporaries could hardly imagine the Commissar was his briefcase for documents. Visitors will be the first to see G.V. Chicherin's black calico briefcase, which dates back to the pre-revolutionary period when the future Commissar lived in exile in Western Europe. We can assume that in 1922, in a similar briefcase, the head of the Soviet delegation brought the text of the keynote speech to the Genoa Conference, which he read in French and English in the hall of the Palazzo San Giorgio and which made a deep impression on the participants of the international forum. It was the first time the representative of the new Soviet government, addressing the global political elites, put forward the principle of peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial economic cooperation between states with different social systems and declared the need for an overall reduction of armaments. One of the items on display is the draft of G.V. Chicherin's speech in Russian, along with photographs taken during the Soviet diplomats' trip to Genoa. As a joke Georgy Vasilievich Chicherin was referred to as 'the head of the Orient faction in the People's Commissariat'. The new foreign policy of the Soviet country indeed reckoned for active diplomatic relations with its Asian neighbours. In this connection, a special place is given to the group of oriental garments presented to G. V. Chicherin by the Asian delegations. Those gifts included a Bukhara robe, which the head of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs wore during the official reception given for the delegation from Bukhara in 1924, and a Mongolian national robe, which replenished the Commissar's closet after he signed the agreement with the Mongolian People's Republic in 1921. In these fanciful oriental robes G.V. Chicherin appears on the photographs and rare documentary footage which are also on display. In the first post-revolutionary years, G.V. Chicherin succeeded in virtually re-forming the office of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and introduced into its activities both – the rich diplomatic experience of the past and new principles and approaches aimed at ensuring the security of the Soviet Union and protecting its interests. It is indicative that the basic goals and guidelines of the Foreign Office, formulated by G. V. Chicherin in the Regulations on the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the USSR dated 12 November 1923, remained relevant throughout the existence of the Soviet Union, being replaced by the Regulations on the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs only at the very end of the 20th century.",

    date: "13.05.2022 – 14.08.2022",
    thumbnailSrc: "https://www.kreml.ru/pi/c4m1/i49616/slaiderdueljpg.jpg",
    detail: "Duelling was born long before the affair of honour of the 18th-19th centuries, well-known thanks to Russian classical literature. Postulates of defending the nobleman’s honour were formed in the 16th-17th centuries to the sound of crossing blades and moans of the deadly wounded. It is to this fascinating time that the exhibition 'The Duel: from Trial by Combat to a Noble Crime' is dedicated. Duels of that era are mostly familiar to us because of the novels of Alexandre Dumas and numerous movies based on them, depicting duellists as noble heroes. But actual duels and duellists are much less known. Unique exhibits will help to immerse in the world of duels of the 16th-17th centuries; many are exhibited in Russia for the first time and never before seen in the same space. The display features over a hundred and forty artefacts – rare drawings, engravings, paintings, treatises on the art of fencing, arms and armour of that time, given on loan by Russian museums and libraries. Duels were preceded by the medieval tradition of trial by combat. In a judicial duel, God was believed to help the one standing up for a righteous cause, as it happened in the Old Testament battle of David and Goliath. The duellers believed that a crime against honour was like murder, and the perpetrator deserved death, so they were entitled to the honour defence in a duel. The honour defence idea was not alien even to monarchs who esteemed the laws of chivalry. The exhibition tells about the planned duel between Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and King Francis I of France that never took place — the portrait of the French King and his armour and arms, as well as the armour of Charles V, are on display. A landmark in the history of duels is the last trial by combat in France, held in 1547 between Baron de Jarnac and Seigneur de La Chateigneraie. That duel was caused by the actions of the future King Henry II, who tried to smear Jarnac. A fine portrait that preserves Henry II's appearance and an engraving of his death scene at the tournament are also on display. Visitors to the exhibition can visualize the 16th-century court duelist thanks to the drawings and engravings, arms and armour and elegant jewellery of that period. The monarchs, the church, and the jurists tried to fight duels considering it an enormous crime. However, they had to reckon with the position of the aristocracy, which often took duellists under its protection. Kings themselves were brought up on chivalric ethics, were considered the first nobles of their kingdoms, and could not ignore the rules of the code of honour. Therefore, the anti-duel policy was inconsistent – the severity of the laws that threatened duellers with capital punishment and confiscation of property was compensated by their non-compliance. Only in some particularly scandalous cases, duellists were subjected to actual prosecution. On display is a portrait of Jean-Baptiste Budes de Guébriant, who had to hide in exile because of his involvement in a duel — but that did not later interfere with the brilliant military career of this French marshal. The art of swordsmanship, which nobles were taught in childhood, is inextricably linked to the advent of duels. On display are duelling weapons and treatises on fencing from the most famous teachers and masters of the 16th-17th centuries. The famous printmaker Jacques Callot's etchings depicting duel scenes accompany the swords used in duels by noble aristocrats. Struggle against the duelling became part of the monarchical policy of subordinating the nobility. King Louis XIV achieved the utmost success in that – he even was proclaimed the vanquisher of duels. A special medal was coined to commemorate this supposed victory. However, he did not manage to eradicate the duelling custom in full. During the Sun King’s reign, duels became rarer and less bloody; they were hidden from the authorities and carried out without witnesses in secluded places. But immediately after the French monarch died, several high-profile duels occurred, marking a new stage in the duelling history. An affair of honour tradition continued and gradually disappeared only in the 20th century.",

The Russian Tsar made contacts with Western Europe on the principles of respect for the national interests of his state and equality with the other great powers. Peter the Great's journeys to West European countries clearly demonstrate how military triumphs and the development of productive forces helped to establish Russia's authority and expand its foreign policy and economic ties.

These include the Tsar's regalia, arms, pieces of clothing, diplomatic gifts presented to him, and various utensils that served him in everyday life. The exhibition will show thirty-two unique objects from the Moscow Kremlin Museums’ collection. Those are ambassadorial gifts from King Charles XII of Sweden, sent before the beginning of the Great Northern War; swords and broadswords of commanders and personal bodyguards of the Swedish king, which became trophies of the Russian army, including those from the Battle of Poltava; the officer badges of the famous Preobrazhensky and Semyonovsky Guards Regiments, as well as the goldkey of Riga presented at the capitulation of the city to the commander of the Russian army, Field Marshal General Count Boris Petrovich Sheremetev.",

Делла-Вос-Кардовской, Н.П. Ульянова, А.С. Голубкиной, С.Т. Конёнкова, Н.А. Андреева. В состав выставки вошли произведения живописи, скульптуры, а также рекламные плакаты и афиши. Именно этой массовой продукции суждено было стать средством коммуникации высокого искусства с запросами обывателей на рубеже веков. Многие крупные именитые художники (К.А. Сомов, Л.С. Бакст, И.Я. Билибин, Е.Е. Лансере, С.Ю. Судейкин) привносили в художественный язык плаката приемы станковой живописи и графики, книжной иллюстрации, открытки, театрально-декорационного искусства. Планомерное формирование массового вкуса осуществлялось через иллюстрации и приложения крупнейшего в России журнала «Нива», с которым сотрудничали Е.П. Самокиш-Судковская, И.С. Горюшкин-Сорокопудов, Д.Н. Кардовский и другие авторы. Афиши выставок, поэтических и музыкальных вечеров, театральных спектаклей и постановок кабаре сохраняют ауру насыщенной событиями и динамичной городской жизни «прекрасной эпохи».",

Впервые перед публикой предстанут 20 шедевров из серии «Воскрешение мертвых» (1921–1922), знаменующей заключительный этап творческой эволюции мастера. На излете 1920 года Чекрыгин знакомится с книгой «Философия общего дела» Николая Фёдоровича Фёдорова и, потрясенный, решает отныне посвятить себя фёдоровской идее преодоления смерти. За короткий срок художник исполняет большой цикл рисунков и ряд живописных произведений, непосредственно связанных с учением Фёдорова. Все они посвящены мистическому «претворению плоти в дух» — объединению материального и духовного. Графическими средствами Чекрыгин добивается впечатления прозрачности и эфемерности телесного начала, преображающегося в потоках света.",

    detail: "Святитель Николай покровительствовал и семье Третьяковых. Дом, где родился Павел Михайлович, находится рядом с храмом Рождества Богородицы в Голутвине, имевшем придел в честь святителя Николая Чудотворца и позднее известный именно с этим посвящением, а храм Николы в Толмачах, прихожанином которого был П.М. Третьяков, стал неотъемлемой частью нашего музея, где пребывает великая святыня — Владимирская икона Богоматери. Экспозицию открывают наиболее ранние из представленных на выставке икон, которые знакомят зрителя с житием святителя Николая. Древнейшая его часть восходит к IV–V векам, а основной текст сложился в IX столетии и повествует о рождении Николая в Патаре и крещении, когда младенец сам стоял в купели, об обучении грамоте, рукоположении в священный сан, исцелении больных и изгнании бесов, о спасении невинно осужденных от казни, утопающих в море — от гибели, нищих девиц — от бесчестия, а также о преставлении Николая и его многочисленных посмертных чудесах. Вопреки представлению о «стандартном» наборе и порядке чтения клейм, житийные циклы большинства икон святого Николая оказываются неповторимыми. За оригинальными иконографическими программами в каждом случае стоит особый замысел, что наглядно демонстрируют иконы из села Мелётово недалеко от Пскова, из коломенского храма Иоанна Богослова, Введенской церкви в Ростове Великом и Николо-Угрешского монастыря. Интересно, что в русских памятниках с конца XIV века часто изображается перенесение мощей святителя Николая из города Миры Ликийские в Бари, в честь которого на Руси был установлен особый праздник, а также так называемые «русские» чудеса: например, спасение утонувшего в Днепре младенца, которого взмолившиеся Николе родители обнаружили в соборе святой Софии целым и невредимым. Другие разделы выставки посвящены особым иконографическим изводам, воспроизводящим чудотворные образы святителя Николая, которые сыграли заметную роль в русской истории и культуре: иконы Николы Зарайского и Николы Великорецкого, а также деревянную статую Николы Можайского. Сама скульптура, изготовленная в XIV веке в память о спасении Можайска от подступившего к городским стенам неприятеля, хранится в Сокровищнице Третьяковской галереи. На выставке представлены ее резные и живописные реплики. Еще одна тема выставки — изображения святителя Николая с другими почитаемыми святыми: мучениками, целителями, благоверными князьями и преподобными. Достаточно рано святитель Николай появляется в композиции Деисуса (моление, прошение. — греч.), а с XV века известны его иконы в составе деисусных чинов иконостаса, где Николай, не писавший богословских трудов, но самой жизнью явивший глубину христианского учения, включается в один ряд с великими учителями Церкви — Василием Великим, Иоанном Златоустом и Григорием Богословом. Примером такого деисусного чина служит комплекс из старообрядческой церкви Успения на Апухтинке.",

    detail: "Выдающийся поэт начала XX века, прозаик, драматург, автор утопических теорий, Хлебников вошел в историю русской литературы как реформатор поэтического языка, гений словотворчества и один из основоположников футуризма в России, придумавший для русской версии этого направления название «будетляне». «В Хлебникове есть всё!» — воскликнул один из крупнейших русских поэтов XX века О. Мандельштам литературоведу Н. Харджиеву, когда тот подарил ему только что вышедший первый том собрания сочинений Хлебникова. Его творчество оказало большое влияние на В. Маяковского, М. Цветаеву, Б. Пастернака, Н. Заболоцкого. С 1915 года Хлебников разрабатывал утопическую идею Правительства Земного Шара из 317 председателей, способных установить справедливый миропорядок. Велимир Хлебников высоко ценил новаторские достижения близких ему по духу художников, полагая, что именно в живописи рождаются наиболее радикальные эстетические принципы, которые могут быть использованы в других областях творчества. «Живопись всегда говорила языком, доступным для всех… На долю художников мысли падает построение азбуки понятий, строя основных единиц мысли, — из них строится здание слова», — писал он. Изображения Хлебникова, включенные в экспозицию, раскрывают дружеские и внутрицеховые связи поэта, являя разные грани творческой и человеческой натуры. Эпиграфом к галерее портретов, представленных на выставке — ликов и обличий Хлебникова, запечатленных как его современниками, так и нынешними почитателями его творчества, можно поставить хлебниковские строки «Моих друзей летели сонмы. Их семеро, их семеро, их сто!». «Королем времени» (так нарекли драматурга друзья-футуристы) он предстает в загадочном символическом портрете Б. Григорьева «Хлебников в будущем» (1916), сосредоточенным и бескомпромиссным вождем «будетлян» — в рисунке В. Маяковского (1916), самопогруженным поэтом — в наброске Н. Кульбина (1913). Свидетелем последних дней Хлебникова стал известный график прошлого столетия П. Митурич, создавший пронзительно скорбные портреты поэта на смертном одре. Еще до личного знакомства с Хлебниковым Митурич стал страстным поклонником его творчества, делал графические композиции по мотивам его произведений, работал над циклом «Пространственная графика», пытаясь создать визуальные образы поэзии своего кумира. После смерти Хлебникова художник занимался изданием его стихов и прозы. Современные интерпретации образа Хлебникова представлены рисунками А. Корсаковой-Рудович, А. Цедрика, скульптурами А. Зеленского и В. Клыкова. Отдельный раздел выставки посвящен семье Велимира Хлебникова. Портреты отца и сестры поэта, выполненные П. Митуричем, также включены в экспозицию. В разделе иллюстраций представлены рисунки соратников Хлебникова к его стихам, поэмам и пьесам, а также коллекция футуристических книг из библиотеки Третьяковской галереи. На их страницах пересекались изобразительное искусство, поэзия, проза и декларации; кубофутуристическая поэзия и живопись тесно переплетались, вырабатывая совместные манифесты и заимствуя друг у друга художественные приемы.",

    detail: "It’s human to fear, it’s human to suffer, it’s human to oppose evil. In 2023, we invite you to an exhibition which we organize in cooperation with the Holocaust Research Center to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The remaining inhabitants of the ghetto, approximately 50,000 'civilian' Jews spent many weeks hiding in shelters and bunkers. Against the despair, loneliness, starvation, thirst and fear, they fought for each and every 'day, hour, minute.' Their quiet resistance was just as important as the resistance of those with guns in their hands. They remained 'invisible' for many days - they hid underground and thus refused to comply to German orders. It is precisely their story - the story of the 'invisible' ones - that we want to retell in the exhibition. We will show what a daily life in a bunker was like, the conditions in the shelters and hideouts, the people who shared them and how they coped with their daily routines and basic physiological needs. We will try to recreate the 'physical' reality of being confined to a bunker: the darkness, the heat coming from burning buildings, the deficit of space and air, the sounds that were often the only way to find out what was happening on the ground level. We will focus on the relations developing between the people who hid together, on their feelings and emotions. On one hand - conflicts, fear, panic attacks, lack of hope, the feeling of being abandoned, of the world’s indifference, of a life forsaken. On the other hand - the craving for love and intimacy, the urge to act and take responsibility for others. The lust for life, the will to save oneself and one’s nearest and dearest, building a community whose members supported and protected one another were a way to oppose evil, too. The exhibition will be based on the testimonies of Jews who hid in the bunkers both in the ghetto area and on the 'Aryan' side. Since all the objects and keepsakes were destroyed and burnt, words acquire a special role in the exhibition. Not only do they convey the feelings and experiences of their authors, but they also constitute a unique testimony, often the only tangible trace left behind by those who perished in the ghetto.",

Shaped over millennia in different locations all across the globe, it has remained very diverse until today. That is why the tale about Jewish food is simultaneously a tale about Jewish religion, culture and history. "What’s Cooking? Jewish Culinary Culture" exhibition takes you on a journey across time and space. We present the diversity of traditions and dishes consumed by Jews residing in the diaspora over the centuries. We demonstrate how certain dishes and products became widespread as a result of numerous migrations, from the Middle Ages to the great waves of migration in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We show the religious foundation which holds Jewish cuisine together—the rules of kashrut which inform the way certain dishes are prepared, as well as breaking away from that tradition today and rediscovering culinary roots. We also encourage our visitors to take a moment to reflect after viewing the four sculptures by Anna Królikiewicz produced especially for the POLIN Museum exposition. By inviting you to come to the Museum and visit the exhibition, we encourage you to join us in seeking an answer to the question: what is Jewish cuisine? While discovering the link between potato pancakes and latkes, gołąbki with holishkes, cholent and adafina; while finding out why the New Yorkers regard pickled ghurkins and borscht as Jewish dishes, we acquaint ourselves with the richness of Jewish culinary culture.',

The small selection of art works in this room shows the breadth of the acquisitions realised during my curatorship, primarily drawings. When I was studying art history in Leiden in the seventies, I developed a preference for early Italian art. This resulted in a doctoral thesis about the drawing books of Jacopo Bellini and a dissertation about Italian drawing books from the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In order to be able to reconstruct drawing books that had been torn apart, I specialised in the history of paper, codicology and the science of watermarks. Dutch art also enjoyed considerable attention in the past four decades, with publications about artists such as Stradanus, Rembrandt, Willem van Mieris and Jan Hulswit. After working as curator at the Royal Library and the Netherlands Office for Fine Arts and deputy chief inspector of Cultural Assets at the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, I joined the museum at the end of 2002. My third curatorship, the longest and most enjoyable. But everything must, unfortunately, come to an end.

With this provocative but humorous scene, the American artist explores the clich\xE9 idea of the macho cowboy. McCarthy\u2019s work is often contrarian, sexually explicit and politically charged.

Others, like Claes Oldenburg, and Tetsumi Kudo, use ordinary objects. Robert Rauschenberg even works with waste materials. Artists also witness the impact of mass media on perception and stereotyping, apparent in works by Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Bloom, and Hans Eijkelboom. SOMEDAY \u2018Someday\u2019 captures the idealism of those decades: in Homo Ludens, Constant explores play as a central element in culture and society, Ben d\u2019Armagnac founds a commune that inspires Louwrien Wijers\u2019s poetic word sculptures. Space travel is hugely influential; astronaut William Anders photographed the Earth, creating an emblem of our planet\u2019s vulnerability, and gave flight to a host of Space Age-inspired designs conceived by such creative minds as V\xE1clav Cigler, JVC, Wim Crouwel and Peter Ghyczy. Pursuing ideals also meant lashing out at established norms, as shown by the immense wall displaying political protest posters. William Irwin\u2019s photos document Civil Rights marches and anti-Vietnam War demonstrations. Corita Kent, Catholic nun and pop art artist, addresses the same themes in her easy-to-distribute silkscreen prints. G\xFCnter Beltzig designs the Floris, a chair to take to sit-in demonstrations. Photos by Maurice Boyer and Pieter Boersma chronicle the squatters\u2019 riots in Amsterdam, while Cor Jaring captures John Lennon and Yoko Ono in the Amsterdam Hilton, promoting world peace in their protest bed-in. The Wild Plakken buttons and Provo magazines epitomise this protest generation\u2019s democratic activism.",

    detail: "Manet, Morisot, Whistler, Cassatt \u2014 these are just a few of the famous painters who were inspired by Rembrandt to start making their own etchings. In the years 1850 they sparked an international revival of the art of etching: The Etching Revival. These works burst with experiment and innovation, with daring compositions and surprising techniques. Rembrandt was an important model for these artists. The Etching Revival was thereby also a Rembrandt Revival. The Rembrandt House Museum recently received a generous gift of international etchings from the collector Neeke Fraenkel-Schoorl. From 11 June dozens of highlights from this collection can be seen in the exhibition Rembrandt Revival. In the audiotour Neeke Fraenkel-Schoorl personally takes you along some of her favourites. The Rembrandt House Museum is also organising inspiring activities and events related to Rembrandt Revival, including etching workshops and a RembrandtLIVE talkshow and podcast. Looking and Comparing The international artists of the Etching Revival often referred to Rembrandt in their works. In the exhibition their work is repeatedly combined with his etchings \u2013 an invitation to look and compare. Rembrandt\u2019s Girl Reading for example resurfaces regularly. But the print that was followed most has to be The Three Trees. This etching was enormously popular in the nineteenth century, and was displayed regularly in the Biblioth\xE8que Nationale in Paris. Many artists knew the etching well and allowed themselves to be inspired by it, especially the sky and the looming clouds. The exhibition also reveals the drive of various artists to innovate and experiment. Extreme light-dark contrasts, the combination of various techniques such as aquatint and roulette, and even an artist who prepared his paper by soaking it in gasoline. Special attention is paid to a group of women artists who starting in the nineteenth century had the opportunity to become professional artists. Even so women experienced considerable resistance. Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassatt, K\xE4the Kollwitz and a number of their contemporaries were nonetheless able to gain a place in the art world and began to make prints. The Neeke Fraenkel-Schoorl Gift Neeke Fraenkel-Schoorl (1942) started collecting prints at an early age. While studying art history she fell in love with the art of printmaking and she went on to work as, among other things, a print specialist at Sotheby\u2019s. From her particular interest in the work of Whistler she developed a focus on the Etching Revival. She has now donated her collection of nearly 400 prints and 200 pieces of graphic art in books and periodicals from the period 1850-1940. Prints form the core of our museum\u2019s collection, but this period was not strongly represented, until now.",

    detail: "The dynamic collection of the Fin-de-Si\xE8cle Museum offers a rotation of artworks on a regular basis. For curatorial reasons around a hundred works on paper, photographs, objects and documents are rotated every six months, thanks to the help of partners. This temporary exhibition, accessible with a ticket to the Fin-de-Si\xE8cle Museum, presents the drawings, photographs and certain paintings that the Belgian artist Henri Evenepoel (Nice, 1872- Paris, 1899) produced during his Algerian period. Despite it being a difficult time in his life, the drawings and paintings made during this period are considered to be among the best of his work. Some fifty known sketches and watercolours show that here, too, it is mainly the human figure that fascinates him. This relatively small number can be explained on the one hand by the fact that Algerians did not want to be portrayed, and on the other by the frequent use of his photo camera, with which he took more than 400 pictures in the four months he spent on the African continent. The Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium hold sixteen paintings, over thirty drawings, a sketchbook and some prints, the collection was also completed in 1970 by hundreds of letters from the artist to his father, as well as 877 negatives of his photographs. On the occasion of this temporary exhibition, a selection of these photographs is now printed in its original state. This has been made possible thanks to the digitisation of the negatives which was carried out by the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage, within the framework of the DIGIT PROGRAMME for the digitisation of the scientific and cultural heritage of the FSI and the Royal Belgian Film Archive (Cinematek), financed by the Federal Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO).",

    detail: "The Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, in close collaboration with the Mus\xE9e national Picasso-Paris, are devoting a unique exhibition to Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) next fall. The two institutions are decrypting a theme that has never been explored before: for the very first time, Picasso's relationship with abstraction will be brought to light, through more than one hundred and forty exceptional works. The exhibition will address the major stages that marked the links between Picasso's work and the history of abstract art, from the first Cubist experiments of 1907, carried out on the fringes of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, to his later work, which is sometimes situated on the borders of action painting. This surprising relationship, made up of small advances, retreats and backward steps, will be presented in the subtle chronological and thematic course of the exhibition, revealing the artist's pendulum movement between abstraction and the figurative over the decades. Another major theme of the exhibition will be the artist's studio, a true formal laboratory, and will show Picasso's creative process through various series (drawings and prints), allowing the viewer to understand how he works and reflects on the representation of the chosen motifs. The studio, which is both a place of creation and a setting for the work, is also the space where the painter's imagination is realised, allowing a glimpse of the ambiguity between reality and fiction. The viewer will not only be invited to appreciate Pablo Picasso's extraordinary creativity and his ability to constantly reinvent himself, but also to measure, through his work, how impulses towards the unknown remain an excellent way of getting to know oneself better and of freeing oneself from the limiting labels. The exhibition is organised in partnership with the Mus\xE9e national Picasso-Paris and is part of the project \"Picasso Celebration 1973-2023\": 50 exhibitions and events to celebrate Picasso.",

    detail: "Miradas de Mujeres (Women\u2019s Gaze) is an exhibition that highlights the view of Belgian artist Isabelle de Borchgrave on Frida Kahlo. Miradas de Mujeres honours a dialogue between two women who have never met \u2013 one being born shortly before the death of the other \u2013 but who nevertheless share their love of fabric, patterns and colours; a women's perspective on the artist\u2019s role in society. Isabelle de Borchgrave took almost three years to create Miradas de Mujeres, a titanic work painted by hand. By using more than 4 kilometers of paper and cardboard she created dresses, carpets, furniture, trees and other elements recreating the unique universe of Frida Kahlo and her iconic house, the Casa Azul (The Blue House). Thanks to Miradas de Mujeres, visitors will have the opportunity to stroll through the living room, the workshop, the kitchen, the dressing room or the garden; promising a unique, trompe l'oeil experience into the world of Frida Kahlo.Far from the image of suffering and pain, linked to the disability of the Mexican icon, Isabelle de Borchgrave focuses here, through colour, on the joy of living of the artist who managed to transcend the hardships of her life in her role as a woman, artist, and cultural icon. The exhibition invites the public to dive into the joyful universe entirely made of paper of Isabelle de Borchgrave and to be inspired by the generosity of this contemporary artist whose creative practice remains resolutely incomparable.",

The exhibition will give the public the opportunity to discover a series of sculptures made of the artist's two favourite materials, beaten copper and bronze, works which, even when small in size, surprise us with their monumentality and sensuality. The selection, which was made in close collaboration with his wife Colette Ghysels, with whom he shares a passion for travelling, tribal art and ethnic jewellery, is also a tribute to the importance the artist attaches to his beloved ones. He says: \u201CIt really makes me happy  when my wife comes into my studio, looks at my work and says she loves it. Then I almost believe it, it warms me and it seems to me, at that moment, that my sculpture reflects us.\" Among the selection: Secret Angle (1973), a polished bronze that entered the museum's collection when Philippe Roberts-Jones was chief curator in 1976, is the oldest work in the series of beaten brass and bronze. According to the artist, \"generating a sculpture means taking a material, dialoguing with it, telling it about space, lines, volumes, curves, verticals, proportions, everything you want for it. It means loving it before it even exists\". Jean-Pierre Ghysels will celebrate his 90th birthday on 20 September.",

    detail: "From October onwards, the Great Hall of the Royal Museums will host a monumental work by the multidisciplinary artist Prune Nourry (Paris, 1985), a rising figure in international contemporary art. L'Amazone \xC9rog\xE8ne (Arc) (2020), which was shown for the first time at the Bon March\xE9 Rive Gauche Paris in 2021, is a work directly linked to her personal battle against breast cancer and is inspired by the mythological figure of the Amazons. A gigantic 5-metres high bow points towards a 4-metres diameter breast-target, evoking the metaphor of the fight against the disease. Beyond its cathartic vocation, the installation, made of wood, feathers and brass, also represents procreation, the target acting as an ovum ready to be fertilised by the arrow shot from the bow. L'Amazone \xC9rog\xE8ne (Arc) thus highlights the tension between gentleness, hope and violence, and gives a personal experience a truly universal resonance. Prune Nourry specialises in sculpture, but also explores a multitude of media such as photography, video and performance. Her cancer diagnosis and mastectomy at the age of 31 inspired the introspective documentary Serendipity. She is very committed to the feminist cause, working on issues ranging from bioethics to women's rights and gender, and emphasises the relationship between art and science in her work. Nourry usually collaborates with anthropologists and geneticists to feed her artistic practice. The French artist trained in wood sculpture at the \xC9cole Boulle in Paris. She lives and works between Paris and Brooklyn, New York, since 2011.",

    detail: "As part of the Museum in Questions campaign launched in the autumn of 2021, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium are keen to participate in the debate surrounding current social matters. Two exhibition rooms contextualise two burning topics for museums around the world: by shedding scientific light on the questions of colonialism and diversity, on the one hand, and the problem of the restitution of cultural goods looted during the Second World War, on the other, the Royal Museums aims to be a laboratory for reflection that will enable us to participate in the construction of the museum of tomorrow, by insisting on how scientific research, one of the museum's primordial missions, can contribute to the contemporary debate. LOOTED ARTWORKS: HOW TO PROCEED WITH THE RESTITUTION OF CULTURAL GOODS LOOTED DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR? The issue of restitution is not new and is in fact broader than the most prominent case, that of the lootings committed during the Second World War and during the Third Reich. The Old Masters and Modern painters brought together in one room bear witness to the complexity and continuing relevance of the issue, some 76 years after the end of the Second World War. There is only one way to identify works of questionable source, and that is to investigate their provenance. Knowing in which hands a work has circulated from the time it left the studio to the present day is an essential but laborious task, which still raises many questions today. The very specific case of the painting by Lovis Corinth presented here reveals the complexity of the restitution process. Are there any international agreements on the matter? Were the lootings organised? Was the art market involved? Where do the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium stand today? These are a few of the questions that we try to answer in this thematic room. Old Masters Museum - Room 51 WHY REVISE THE TITLE OF A RUBENS MASTERPIECE? Titles of artworks are being questioned in museums around the world: the responsibility of museums to be inclusive and non-discriminatory has grown in intensification following social movements such as #metoo or #BlackLivesMatter. The Rubens work in this room, which has been renamed for the second time after 2007, is a typical example of how a title can remind the public of a painful colonial experience. The Royal Museums validate the public\u2019s reactions and aim to commit to a policy of inclusion, based on historical facts and contexts, and thus, in that way, contribute to a scientifically based debate. Why is the title of a Rubens masterpiece today now more than ever the subject of discussion? Why was this oil sketch originally untitled and what was its function in Rubens\u2019s studio? What were Rubens's original intentions and what place did people from Africa have in his thinking and work? These are all questions around which we would like to stimulate a constructive dialogue.",

We display objects from everyday life: flint tools used by the Neanderthals, earthenware pots from the first agricultural societies, stylish tableware from Roman times... Many objects illustrate important social changes. For example, bronze swords demonstrate the emergence of an elite in the Iron Age. A unique hoard of gold coins speaks of the conquest of our region by the Roman general Julius Caesar. Our core collection proves that Roman culture also took root in our region. There are impressive architectural fragments, elegant pieces of jewellery and a wide range of Roman statues of gods and Roman pottery. The wealth of artifacts from tumulus graves also appeals to the imagination. The exhibition is perfectly suited for a visit with children. There are educational films, models and lifelike figures in synthetic resin. Interactive applications provide a playful way to discover the past. Be sure to pick up the child-friendly audio guide on arrival. Archaeologist \u2018Bob the Digger\u2019 talks enthusiastically about his love for the past. He guides children to the most fascinating objects, introducing them to the world in which our ancestors lived. Bob also takes them behind the scenes at the museum where fun quiz questions will inspire kids to learn more - like: Who are the specialists he works with? Which pieces were his own finds? Kids are guaranteed a fascinating experience, from start to finish.",

    detail: "The Thracians are the oldest and largest ethnic group on the Balkans since the fourth millennium BC. Warlike and daring, the Thracians had perfected the art of war and were recognized as superb warriors. Invited and favoured allies to many of their ancient neighbours, they gave the world Orpheus and the great leader of the oppressed slaves \u2013 Spartacus. In the fifth century BC, the Thracians founded the kingdom of the Odrysai. Thracian material culture\u2019s contacts with that of Classical Greece and the Roman Empire had provided striking masterpieces to our national treasury. In the seventh century AD, the agile cavalry of the proto-Bulgarians, led by Khan Asparukh, entered into a robust war alliance with the infantry of the Slav peoples, permanently settled in the lands south of the Danube River. One of the first European Medieval states \u2013 Bulgaria, was founded. The victorious wars against the Byzantine Empire, the Arabs, the Avars, etc. invaders, expanded the country\u2019s territory and raised it to a primary power in the European South-East. History remembers the Bulgarian rulers Krum, Simeon the Great, and Samuil, not only as wise statesmen, but also as extraordinary military leaders. The Battle of Varbitsa Pass of 811; Byzantian defeat of 917 at Achelous River; the unsurpassed by its strategic plan and execution war of 986, advanced European art of war. The Tarnovo Uprising of 1185\u20131187, led by the bolyars [Bulgarian noblemen] Asen and Petar, restored Bulgarian statehood and marked the onset of a political and military growth. New fortifications were built; all typical to the period branches of the military were set up \u2013 light and heavy cavalry and infantry, siege engine crews, and a navy. Offence emerges as the primary strategic measure. Bulgarian state borders on three seas \u2013 the Black, the Aegean, and the Adriatic Sea. In the Battle of Adrianople of 1205, Tsar Kaloyan triumphed over the never before defeated army of the Western European knights-crusaders. After the victory against the Despot of Epirus, Theodore Komnenos in 1230, the Bulgarian monarch Ivan Asen II proudly proclaimed himself \u201CTsar of Bulgarians and Byzantians\u201D. The armed resistance of the Bulgarian and the rest of the Balkan peoples at the end of the fourteenth century had decisive role in thwarting Ottoman invasion in Europe.",

    detail: "After half a century of struggle against the Ottomans, in 1396 the Bulgarian lands finally fell to the conqueror. Bulgarians refused to tolerate the deprivation of their rights, as indicated by the constant unrest and uprisings. After the failed 1408 uprising of Konstantin and Fruzhin \u2013 the heirs apparent to the throne, Bulgarians offered support to the army of the Polish-Hungarian King Vladislav III Yagiellon and the Transylvanian Voivode Janos Hunyadi during their campaigns in Bulgaria of 1443 and 1444, and took part in the decisive Battle of Varna, on November 10, 1444. Within a century, three uprisings erupted: the First Tarnovo (1598), the Second Tarnovo (1686), and the Chiprovtsi Uprising (1688). Already in the first decades of the Ottoman rule, the indigenous form of unyielding resistance against infringements on the personal, family, religious, and national honour and dignity \u2013 the hajduk movement was securely established. In the 1860s, the combat expertise from the centuries of armed struggles was re-articulated in terms of ideology, military tactics, and politics. The transition from a spontaneous political fights to an organized national liberation movement became associated with the name and work of Georgi Sava Rakovski. The First Bulgarian Legion (1862), founded by him, took part in the siege and in the fights for the capture of the Belgrade Fortress. By their weapons, accoutrements, outfit, and tactical skills, the cheta [local term for band] of Panayot Hitov and Filip Totyu, of Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha, and many more came close to the requisites of regular armies. At the end of 1869, in Bucharest were laid the foundations of a new governing body of the Bulgarian national liberation movement \u2013 the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), headed by Lyuben Karavelov. Vasil Levski was its most prolific member, who in less than three years set up a vast network of revolutionary committees, known as Internal Revolutionary Organization (IRO), which primed the populace for fight. While the preparation for the impending uprising were still in progress, Vasil Levski, a.k.a. the \u2018Apostle of Freedom\u2019, was seized, tried, and on February 19, 1873, near Sofia, executed by hanging. His Internal Revolutionary Organization was a new stage in the evolution of the movement for Bulgarian national liberation. The aggravation of the Eastern Crisis in the summer of 1875, galvanized the members of the BRCC and the revolutionary committees in the Bulgarian lands. At the end of 1875, the Bulgarian revolutionaries Stefan Stambolov, Panayot Volov, Stoyan Zaimov, Nicola Obretenov, Georgi Benkovski, and many more, decided to organize an uprising for the spring of 1876. The lands were divided into four revolutionary regions. The uprising erupted in April of 1876. In the violent suppression by the Ottoman authorities were massacred more than 30 000 Bulgarian men, women and children; 80 settlements were set on fire; further 200 \u2013 ransacked. The international community was outraged. More than 3000 articles in close to 200 newspapers called for support to the Bulgarian cause. Their authors were notable politicians, writers, and academics from all over the world: Giuseppe Garibaldi, Otto von Bismarck, William Gladstone, Charles Darwin, Konstantin Jirecek, Lev Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev, Dmitri Mendeleev, etc.",

Steps were made to neutralize Austria-Hungary and the Great Britain. Romania agreed to join in the campaign with a 40 000 strong army and a free passage for the Russian troops. The Russo-Turkish war was declared on 12 April 1877, at Kishinev, through a manifesto signed by Emperor Alexander II. After a successful preparation, in the first hours of 27 June 1877, 14 Infantry Division of General M.I. Dragomirov crossed the Danube River at Svishtov and entered Bulgarian territory. The Russian Danube Army was divided into three detachments: Front, Eastern and Western. The Front Detachment, of about 12 000 men under command of General Iosif Gurko, was tasked with liberating the settlements in Central North Bulgaria and entering South Bulgaria. To the Front Detachment was attached the Bulgarian Volunteer Corps of 12 battalions with a total strength of 12 634 men. It was formed by order No. 40 /14 April 1877 of the Supreme Commander of the Russian Army. On 6 May 1877, the Corps was sworn in and awarded its battle flag. As its chief was assigned Gen.

The exhibit shows how the medium of photography functioned in the creation and dissemination of new urban vistas. In this way, the images also tell the story of a rapidly changing metropolis. They capture the hustle and bustle on streets, squares, and markets, uncover unexpected encounters, and document moments of indolence and pleasure.

    detail: "The Siemensstra\xDFe settlement (1950\u201354) in Floridsdorf is one of the outstanding examples of social housing and urban development in post-war Vienna. It was highly respected internationally and is now a designated cultural heritage site. At the time of its construction, the settlement was the largest municipal housing complex in Vienna, with over 1700 apartments. After the Second World War, the housing shortage in Vienna was dramatic. Over 86,000 apartments were destroyed or unusable. As an important industrial location, Floridsdorf was particularly affected. To quickly cover the most urgent housing needs, the city initiated a so-called rapid construction project in addition to the regular residential construction program. By 1954, about 4,000 additional apartments had been built. Many of the more than 1,700 apartments were designed as so-called duplex apartments, small apartments (approx. 30m\xB2), which could later be combined without great technical effort. In keeping with the demands of social urban planning, which aimed to separate work, living and recreation, the settlement was built in the immediate vicinity of the large Floridsdorf industrial plants, featuring generous open and green spaces. In addition, Siemensstrasse offered the residents a rich infrastructure, such as a community center, kindergarten, children's outdoor pool, bathhouse, and a series of stores. The architect Franz Schuster (1892\u20131972) planned the housing project according to the \"New Neighborhood\" concept originating in the Anglo-American realm. This was intended to enable residents to live private lives while taking different needs into account. Separate building and apartment types were designed for families, single people, war invalids and the elderly, such as the \"Heimst\xE4tte f\xFCr alte Menschen\". Franz Schuster had already built in Red Vienna (with Franz Schacherl, he designed the settlement \"Am Wasserturm\", X., 1923\u20131924; with, among others, Margarete Sch\xFCtte-Lihotzky and Adolf Loos the \"Otto Haas-Hof\" in the XX. ,1924\u20131926) as well as the Montessori Kindergarten on Rudolfsplatz (I., 1929\u201331). In 1926, he moved to Frankfurt, where he worked as an associate of Ernst May in one of the centers of architectural modernism in Europe. In 1937, he was appointed to the School of Applied Arts in Vienna as the successor to Josef Hoffmann. In 1938, he served the National Socialists\u2019 planning agenda and participated, among other things, in the planning of the demolition of Leopoldstadt. Alas, this did not hinder his career after 1945. He retained his position as professor and played a decisive role in the reconstruction of Vienna. In addition to the Per Albin Hansson settlement (X., 1947\u201351, together with Eugen W\xF6rle and Stefan Simony, among others) and the special kindergarten \"Schweizer Spende\" (XV.), the Siemensstrasse settlement was one of his major works during this period. The exhibition \"Terra Nova - 70 Years of Siemensstrasse Settlement\" explores the strengths of social urban planning and the concept of the New Neighborhood. It was conceived in close cooperation with contemporary witnesses and tells about the living culture and everyday life of the 1950s. It can be seen in a duplex apartment at Scottgasse 5.

MCA Collection: Perspectives on place brings together artworks that explore the social and physical aspects of place. It has been imagined as an expanded map, which weaves together a picture of the world made from rituals, memories, metaphors, imprints and repurposed materials. The works stem from specific sites to illuminate broader ideas around geopolitics and environmental change, communal life and custodianship. Collectively they reveal how the notion of place is entwined with different cultural perspectives on time, history and belonging. The exhibition is drawn from the MCA\u2019s diverse collection of over 4500 artworks. It includes recent acquisitions, collection highlights and works owned jointly with Tate, London, through a groundbreaking international partnership. Since its inception in 1989, the Museum has acquired new and recent works by living artists across all media, shaping a distinctive history of art from Australia as it unfolds.",

Since the 1970s Ely has been working across sculpture, installation and performance to address ecological and socio-political issues grounded in the context of Australia. This presentation focuses on two of Ely\u2019s performance works from the 1980s \u2013 Murray River Punch (1980) and Controlled Atmosphere (1983) \u2013 that highlight human mismanagement of and interference in Australian waterways. Ely\u2019s research into complex environmental concerns and our relationship to the natural world continues to be a mainstay of her practice. While Murray River Punch (1980) and Controlled Atmosphere (1983) were first made over five decades ago, they retain an enduring relevance to the unfolding global ecological crisis of today. Ely\u2019s early eco-feminist performance work Jabiluka UO\u2082 (1979) is also currently on display as part of MCA Collection: Perspectives on place.

Binns rose to prominence in the 1960s with her psychedelic depictions of sexual imagery, which anticipated the feminist art movement. Since that time, she has continued to shape some of the most significant developments in Australian visual culture, both within and beyond the domain of the gallery. Binns\u2019 outstanding contribution to Australian art was recognised in 2021 with an Australia Council Award for Visual Arts. Vivienne Binns: On and through the Surface is the first retrospective of Binns\u2019 multifaceted practice. A partnership between the MCA and Monash University Museum of Art, it brings together over 100 artworks spanning six decades alongside a rich selection of archival materials. The exhibition charts the key periods, themes and methods in Binns\u2019 work, from her early iconic depictions of the body to the socially transformative impact of her community projects, and the breadth of ideas that she has explored since returning to studio practice in the 1980s. Above all, it reflects Binns\u2019 enduring interest in testing the possibilities of the painted surface.

    detail: "Daniel Boyd: Treasure Island is the artist\u2019s first major exhibition to be held in an Australian public institution. Featuring more than 80 works from across his nearly two-decade career, the exhibition unpacks the ways in which Boyd holds a lens to colonial history, explores multiplicity within narratives and interrogates blackness as a form of First Nations resistance. Working with an idiosyncratic painting technique that partially obscures the composition, Boyd refigures archival imagery, art historical references and his own family photographs, asking us to contend with histories that have been hidden from view. The exhibition includes new work and commissioned spatial interventions. Highlights include his iconic early work Treasure Island 2005; Untitled (ZVDG) 2014 from his famed History is made at night (Kochi) series; and the intimate Untitled (BAT) 2020, one of the artist\u2019s first large-scale works drawing from his personal archive of lived experiences and memories. As well as revealing some of the richness and diversity of contemporary Indigenous art practices, and Australian contemporary art more broadly, Daniel Boyd: Treasure Island offers a thoughtful and thought-provoking response to the current moment. It is accompanied by a richly illustrated publication, featuring all new writing by the exhibition\u2019s co-curators and commissioned First Nations authors, offering critical insight into Boyd\u2019s practice as well as creative and experimental responses to his work.",

    detail: "Sol LeWitt (1928\u20132007) was a pivotal figure in 20th-century American art whose ideas continue to have an impact on artists around the world. Many of his artworks were conceived as sets of instructions that could be executed by others. He often likened his process to that of a composer whose music acquired subtle differences with each new performance. This exhibition, presented in collaboration with Kaldor Public Art Projects, places LeWitt\u2019s work in conversation with paintings by Anmatyerr artists Emily Kame Kngwarreye and Gloria Tamerre Petyarre. It also introduces three musical commissions, each developed collaboratively by an American musician and an Aboriginal musician: Chuck Johnson and JWPATON; Steve Gunn and amby downs; and Claire Rousay and E Fishpool. LeWitt\u2019s enormous wall drawing Wall drawing #955, Loopy Doopy (red and purple) 2000 \u2013 installed in the John Kaldor Family Hall on the ground level \u2013 reveals the influence Australian Central Desert painters had on his practice, including Kngwarreye, whose work he first encountered at the Venice Biennale in 1997. LeWitt described feeling a \u2018great affinity\u2019 for Kngwarreye\u2019s work and went on to become an avid collector of paintings by her, Petyarre and other Central Desert artists. Sol LeWitt: Affinities and Resonances explores the connections between these seemingly disparate art-making traditions while also examining the processes of creation and collaboration through three musical compositions developed in response to Loopy Doopy (red and purple). Also on display is LeWitt\u2019s Wall drawing 388 in the 20th-century galleries on lower level 1.",

Brett Whiteley followed in this long tradition, producing ceramics solely in these colours, in a lesser known tranche of his art practice. Blue, of course, can be found not only in the sweeping lines that follow the forms of his rounded ceramics, but also in the blue ink applied with brush to paper in his calligraphic drawings and the rich deep blue of the Sydney Harbour paintings for which he is famed.\u200B This exhibition presents a rare focus on Whiteley's ceramics, along with related prints and drawings, augmented by select paintings, many of which include depictions of blue-and-white ware.",

One artist will receive a three-month residency at the Cit\xE9 Internationale des Arts in Paris and $40,000, while five artists will each receive $10,000 and a two-week residency at the Shark Island Institute in Kangaroo Valley, New South Wales. The winners will be announced on 26 October 2022. This year, the entries will be judged by guest artist Mitch Cairns, who won the scholarship in 2012. Works by each scholarship recipient will be exhibited at the Brett Whiteley Studio. The annual scholarship was created from an endowment by Beryl Whiteley, who died in 2010. It was inspired by the profound effect international travel and study had on her son, the artist Brett Whiteley, as a result of winning the Italian Government Travelling Art Scholarship at the age of 20. Previously, the Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship was awarded to a single artist each year and included a three-month residency at the Cit\xE9 Internationale des Arts in Paris. However, due to COVID-19 international travel restrictions, it was not possible to host the 2020 and 2021 scholarship recipients overseas, and instead a local residency was awarded to five artists. Thanks to the continuing generosity of Shark Island Kangaroo Valley, in 2022, both the overseas and the local residencies will be awarded.",

    detail: "Share this page on TwitterShare this page on FacebookEmail this page MUSEUM OF SYDNEY Unrealised Sydney presents a fascinating insight into the future of our city as it was imagined in the past. The imagined city precedes the built city. Ideas for new buildings and precincts can reveal much about the time of their conception: economic drivers, politics, technological change, and prevailing views on society, environment and design. Cities evolve as a dialogue between the possible and the actual, with change often contested. Many visions are left behind, unrealised, ghostly reminders of the city that might have been. Guest curated by Robert Freestone, Unrealised Sydney explores the genesis of, and community responses to, bold and sometimes misguided design proposals by governments and the private sector for redeveloping some strategic sites in and around the CBD in the second half of the 20th century. Though never realised, these schemes \u2013 shown through a range of plans, designs, models, sketches and documentary footage \u2013 form a rich part of the story that is Sydney. These decades saw shifting ideas about architectural and urban design, heritage, and democratic governance. Controversial urban renewal projects raised stark questions about global versus local priorities and private versus public interests. The processes of reimagination and renewal continue apace. As we continually refashion our cities for the future, what can we learn from past unrealised visions? Accompanying the exhibition is Realise, an interactive experience developed in collaboration with media producers Junior Major. Visitors modify precincts in Tallawoladah / The Rocks, considering factors such as environmental sustainability, liveability and productivity \u2013 then see them brought to life in the gallery. Daily screenings of the 1978 documentary Woolloomooloo will take place at 2pm in the Warrane Theatre, Museum of Sydney, courtesy National Film and Sound Archive \xA9 Bower Bird Films.",

Nesse cantinho, h\xE1 uma maquete da cidade de Ilh\xE9us, onde o escritor, nascido no distrito de Ferradas, em Itabuna, viveu por muito tempo, e uma escultura de Jorge Amado com um ano de idade ao lado da matriarca. J\xE1 onde antes havia uma piscina est\xE1 o \u201CLago dos sapos\u201D, uma esp\xE9cie de ran\xE1rio, com sapos e r\xE3s que tanto fascinavam o escritor, e a exibi\xE7\xE3o da novela sonora baseada na obra infantil de Jorge Amado chamada \u201CO gato malhado e a andorinha Sinh\xE1\u201D. No jardim, lugar m\xE1gico da casa, est\xE1 o espa\xE7o \"Jorge e o Candombl\xE9\" que ressalta a rela\xE7\xE3o entre o Ob\xE1 (posto civil que exercia no Il\xEA Ax\xE9 Ap\xF4 Afonj\xE1) Jorge Amado e o Candombl\xE9, com um depoimento in\xE9dito de M\xE3e Stella abordando a amizade com o escritor e fundamentos sobre a religi\xE3o de matriz africana. No mesmo espa\xE7o, o visitante pode interagir virtualmente com Carlinhos Brown utilizando instrumentos t\xEDpicos dos rituais do Candombl\xE9. Vale lembrar que Jorge Amado, quando deputado constituinte, em 1945, foi autor da lei que assegura o direito \xE0 liberdade de culto religioso no Brasil. Leituras e sabores: \u201CN\xE3o escrevi meu primeiro livro pensando em ficar famoso. Escrevi pela necessidade de expressar o que sentia\u201D, disse uma vez Jorge Amado, que publicou o primeiro romance \u2013 \u201CO pa\xEDs do Carnaval\u201D \u2013 em 1931, com apenas 19 anos de idade. Ap\xF3s a morte, em 6 de agosto de 2001, quatro dias antes de completar 89, o mais famoso escritor brasileiro deixou 45 livros publicados, segundo a Funda\xE7\xE3o Casa de Jorge Amado. Grande parte dessas obras teve trechos lidos e gravados por artistas e familiares que podem ser vistos na resid\xEAncia da Rua Alagoinhas. No total, s\xE3o 47 leituras em v\xEDdeo. Elas podem ser vistas no espa\xE7o \u201CSala das leituras\u201D, ao lado da biblioteca, em uma tela de cinema. Entre as pessoas que fizeram leituras de trechos das obras de Jorge Amado est\xE3o nomes como Caetano Veloso, Regina Cas\xE9, Daniela Mercury, Ivete Sangalo, S\xF4nia Braga, Mariana Ximenez, Marisa Orth, Mateus Solano, Paloma Amado, Milton Gon\xE7alves e Paulinho da Viola. \u201CNessas leituras fica evidente a atemporalidade de Jorge Amado, um escritor \xE0 frente do seu tempo e que era popular porque sempre retratou o povo\u201D, afirmou Gringo Cardia. Dois espa\xE7os s\xE3o reservados \xE0 gastronomia na vida e no trabalho de Jorge Amado e Z\xE9lia Gattai: \u201COs amados sabores de Jorge\u201D e \u201CCozinha de Dona Flor\u201D. A quituteira Dad\xE1 ensina algumas das receitas de del\xEDcias que marcaram presen\xE7as em livros como \u201CDona Flor e seus dois maridos\u201D, como a punheta (bolinho de estudante), vatap\xE1, caruru e acaraj\xE9. Esses dois espa\xE7os foram carinhosamente preparados por Paloma Amado, filha do casal de escritores, e autora do livro \u201CA comida baiana de Jorge Amado\u201D, reunindo receitas e hist\xF3rias de pratos t\xEDpicos que aparecem nas obras do pai.",

From Clairtone's Project G Stereo to Fluevog footwear, this exhibition showcases one hundred examples of culturally significant, limited-edition and mass-produced objects designed and crafted in Canada, and the stories of insight, experimentation, and innovation behind them. Inspired by everything from pop culture and the Swinging Sixties to Canada's natural landscape and the Space Race, Canadian innovation was embraced by global markets, putting the country's designs on the world stage, where many of them continue to hold a place \u2014 and function \u2014 today. Whether it's fashion, furniture, jewellery, electronics, or ceramics, each object tells a story \u2014 some new, some nostalgic \u2014 and this exhibition invites visitors to take a fresh look at these everyday objects.

    detail: "Strong colours, clear geometrical forms, and patterns ranging from graceful to luxurious are the hallmarks of miniature paintings from the Indian region of Bundelkhand. Located south of the cities of Delhi and Agra, the princely courts of Orchha, Datia, and Panna produced exceptional masterpieces of Indian art that offer thorough insights into the practices and stylistic development of artists reacting to the region's cultural and political trends over the course of three hundred years until the 19th century. Eva and Konrad Seitz have now donated their Bundelkhand miniatures to the Rietberg Museum. The only museum outside India to be so endowed, the Rietberg Museum can now devote an exhibition to the remarkable story of this unique collection. In their choice of subjects, Bundelkhand artists focused largely on the classic themes of Indian art: they depicted events of sacred texts and passages of love poetry in regional languages. Their works peerlessly blended the Hindu ideal of devotion (bhakti) and aesthetic sensibility. Always uppermost in the minds of artists was Indian art theory's pre-eminent concept of rasa (taste, essence, flavour, juice) and the question of how to convey it to those viewing their paintings. Four series of images produced in the late 16th century mark the start of our story of painting in Bundelkhand. Artists initially proved receptive to the early influences of Mughal art. Political disputes with the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan prompted a return to the initial style, however. With the breakdown of authority in Orchha, artistic production diverged into two contrasting styles: based on early painting, an expressive and ornamental style involving imaginative eccentric compositions evolved in Orchha. By contrast, in Datia, where the political elite had sought exile, the influence of Mughal painting intensified, and artists increasingly portrayed scenes from Sanskrit poetry. This gave rise to the unique combination of Mughal-influenced figures and abstract backgrounds that is characteristic of the Bundelkhand style. For decades, it was assumed that these paintings were the work of itinerant artist families around Malwa (south-east of Rajasthan). In his two-volume study titled \u201COrchha, Datia, Panna: Miniaturen von den rajputischen H\xF6fen Bundelkhands 1580 \u2013 1820\u201D, and on the basis of his own extensive collection, Konrad Seitz in 2015 demonstrated not only that the so-called \u201CSchool of Malwa\u201D had its geographical source elsewhere \u2013 namely in the workshops of the courts of Bundelkhand \u2013 but also that it should be dated a generation or so earlier. Our exhibition sets out to illustrate how such art-historical attributions and categories arise and can change. For the occasion, Konrad Seitz\u2019s study is to be re-issued in a revised and expanded edition in English. The author\u2019s research and the Bundelkhand miniatures donated by him and his wife Eva will be presented to the public for the first time in this exhibition at the Rietberg Museum.",

    detail: "Softly translucent with a matte lustre, silky smooth to the touch yet harder than steel, created by nature and crafted by the human hand \u2013 no other material was as beloved in China as jade. This fascinating stone \u2013 in China, jade primarily refers to nephrite \xAD\u2013 comes in subtle shades ranging from milky white to pink and green to almost black. Its hardness and toughness pose the greatest challenges to artisans. Only by grinding it with quartz sand can jade be brought into shape, and only through days of polishing does it reveal its magical lustre. All the more impressive is the fineness and richness of detail in Chinese jade objects. The exhibition invites visitors to discover jade miniatures from the museum's collection. The small sculptures, many only a few centimetres in size, only reveal their full charm upon closer inspection. The figurines are accompanied by large-format photographs by the Zurich photographer Felix Streuli. His images bring the objects to life, unveil their spirit, and reveal minute details. The magnificent pictures, themselves works of art, form a wonderful ensemble with the jade figures. Jade has been closely associated with power and status in China since earliest times. Emblems of rank made of jade were part of court etiquette as early as the 1st millennium BC. At the same time, the material itself was fascinating. No other stone was so robust and resistant, so hard and durable. Hence, jade was also ascribed a protective function. People wore jade amulets in this world and the beyond to ward off evil forces and keep demons at bay. From the 10th century onwards, archaic jades became popular collectibles. Among members of the learned upper class, it soon became fashionable to own a personal collection of antique pieces. New forms of jade objects also gained favour. In particular, objects for a literati's desk such as wrist rests, water containers used in painting and calligraphy, and animal figures as paperweights became popular. The allure of jade peaked in the 18th century. In their designs, artisans skilfully exploited the material\u2019s natural qualities such as changing hues or the presence of inclusions. Objects were crafted in the shape of animals and plants in all variations and combinations, with the carvers\u2019 imagination knowing no bounds, and their designs revealing breath-taking delicacy.",

    detail: "Since 1952, the Museum Rietberg has brought together unique art made by the world\u2019s very different cultures \u2013 but how did it get here? What routes did it take? What modifications in material and changes in meaning did it undergo on its travels? The exhibition Pathways of Art traces these routes and shows across some 20 stations who was involved in the trade and respective acquisitions and who owned the works before they entered the museum. Its focus, then, is on the question of provenance, that is, the objects\u2019 stories of origin, with emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. Closely linked with these object biographies comes a rich variety of encounters and connections between individuals, institutions, and even countries that the exhibition seeks to examine more closely. An important aspect concerns the mode in which works were presented, along with the issue of aestheticization and musealization. Central to this is the question of how an object comes to be seen as art. The exhibition additionally considers the different types of knowledge associated with a work of art: what type of understanding inscribes itself into a work, how is it transmitted, modified, and reconstructed? The exhibition considers all these and other aspects. With its critical examination of the origins of its collection, the Museum Rietberg seeks to contribute to a debate of public interest about the approach it takes to its collections and their historical background. The extensive and illustrated catalogue, published by Scheidegger & Spiess in English and German, in which twenty authors explore the museum's collections from different perspectives serves as a reader to the exhibition.

Spread over three separate spaces, visitors can explore the topics \u2018Orient\u2019, \u2018Seafaring\u2019 and \u2018Railways\u2019, with plenty of hands-on fun. In an Arabian palace, on the deck of a large sailing ship and in a vintage railway carriage, young Museum visitors can really get a feel for these momentous eras in global history. The exhibition combines learning with activities designed specially for children. The exquisitely designed backdrop provides space for imaginations to run free at the Museum, and the beautiful original objects are important witnesses to these epochs in the cultural history of our world. For families with children aged 4 and over.",

    detail: "Baroque is more than a matter of style. This cultural epoch, between 1580 and 1780, was a time of enormous contrasts: opulence and innovation on the one hand, death and crises on the other. Ongoing religious wars and the opening up of global trade networks resulted in power gains and cultural exchange, but there was also famine and exploitation. Switzerland played its part in all this radical change: Swiss architects designed major works throughout Europe, Swiss artists and scientists were part of international networks, clothing and interiors reflected the culture of the French court, and the worldwide circulation of products and knowledge had life-changing impacts. The exhibition presents beautiful objects from Baroque architecture, garden culture, fashion and art, focusing on the historical context of these items in order to illuminate this creative epoch in all its glorious ambiguity.",

    detail: "When the first teaching materials and instructional films for teaching in driving schools began to appear in the early 1960s, they often did not reach the teachers, but remained locked away in closets. Ji\u0159\xED Pour, an employee of the then Driving School Directorate, tried to change this unfortunate trend. He initiated the \u201CNational Parades of Teaching Materials\u201D, the first of which took place in 1964 in Vy\u0161kov. A total of three parades took place. Since then, that is, during the last almost 60 years, only five similar exhibitions have taken place, mostly on a local level, under the care of regional museums. The exhibition at the National Memorial in V\xEDtkov describes the history and development of the Czechoslovak driver education system, not only in the field of teaching aids, but also in the method of drivers\u2019 training, methods, international cooperation, testing. It offers a look into the whole spectrum of this field, often from perspectives hidden from the average driver. In addition, the exhibition is dedicated to the life and work of the aforementioned Ji\u0159\xED Pour, who was undoubtedly one of the greatest figures of the Czechoslovak driver education system and who passed away at a ripe age only recently. Many of the exhibits were his property. The aim of the authors of the exhibition is to bring the experience to both the general public, coming from a general interest in motoring, and driving instructors with professional interest. And then to bring a little nostalgia to everybody. The central installation of the entire exhibition is a \u201Cdriving school room\u201D with three simulators, which will be available to visitors as part of guided tours. It is also possible to see instructional models of engines, driving school textbooks and driving licences from the entire 20th century here.",

    detail: "The exhibition When the Stars Shine commemorates well-known and famous, but also almost forgotten stars of Czech theatre of the last two centuries. Through the best and most interesting items from the collections of the History of Theatre department of the National Museum, the exhibition shows the vicissitudes of the position of theatre creators in society over the course of more than two hundred years. The exhibition thus offers the opportunity to see objects from the personal estates of great actors (e.g. Ema Destinnov\xE1, Hana Kvapilov\xE1, Jind\u0159ich Mo\u0161na, Old\u0159ich Nov\xFD, Adina Mandlov\xE1, Svatopluk Bene\u0161, Karel H\xF6ger, Vlasta Chramostov\xE1, Radovan Lukavsk\xFD and many others). On display are their jewellery, clothes and fashion accessories, personal and studio photographs, paintings and busts, small artefacts from everyday and artistic life, and remarkable documents. In particular, you can see, for example, Emma Destinnov\xE1's jewellery, Old\u0159ich Nov\xFD's office, Adina Mandlov\xE1's dresses, furniture from Vlasta Chramostov\xE1\u2019s living room theatre or Cinderella's magical dress and shoe from the fairy tale Three Gifts for Cinderella. You can also take a look at the Thalia Award given to Josef Abrh\xE1m in 2020 or the Czech Lion awarded to Ivan Trojan in the same year. The specific life and artistic stories of several dozen prominent personalities of the Czech Thalia offer a reflection on how great actors influence the life, fashion or aesthetic ideals of their time, what it meant to be famous and respected by the society in different times, and what creative and personal conflicts shaped their life paths. At the same time, the authors of the exhibition do not shy away from controversial topics, such as what the Czech saying that success is unforgivable often means in real life, how power and politics influenced the actors' life and work, and what creative and personal dramas many actors experienced. The exhibition also shows the lesser-known or even unknown facts about how these personalities lived their private lives or what they did outside their profession. The exhibition presents the fates of the stars of the Czech Thalia against the backdrop of their times, pays homage to the art of acting in all its forms and variants, genres and art forms, and above all wants to remind us that all these actors were still just human.",

    detail: "What did the war mean for its participants and for those affected indirectly? The exhibition \u201CFaces of War\u201D explains how people from different parts of the world legitimised their participation in wars and war related activities with religious ideology and how they clarified their relationship with Gods and other people through battle and bloodshed, how leaders and monarchs secured their positions using the archetype of a warrior. It also draws attention to the economic aspect of war campaigns. The exhibition dedicates a large space to fighting and its \u201Ctools\u201D: weapons and armours. It shows how weapons adapted to the specific natural environment as well as to the techniques and tactics of combat. It also presents weapons that are literally works of art, as well as artistic representations of war. Art is not about cruelty and suffering, it mainly celebrates magnificence, strength and martial arts. The last part of the exhibition is focused on the persistent desire of human societies for peace, the efforts to break free from the cycle of violence, attacks and retaliation. The exhibition features a number of unique objects. There is also a collection of tin soldiers borrowed from the funds of the Army Museum, which demonstrates how the clash of European civilisation and \u201Cprimitive\u201D war practices fascinated our ancestors \u2013 and their children \u2013 at the beginning of the 20th century. It also emphasises the fact that a preparation for war remains an important part of children\u2019s games in modern society. Among the most beautiful and most conspicuous exhibited objects is the mask of the Mongolian God of war, which combines the charm of artistic craftsmanship and the reflection of the cruelty of conflicts, pointing out the importance of war in religious ceremonies and its impact on everyday life. A six-part Japanese screen from the 17th century shows scenes from the riots of H\u014Dgen, which took place in 1156 in Kyoto as an attempt to change the order of succession to the imperial throne. The screen shows the liberation of the rebel-controlled imperial palace, the breakthrough of a poorly guarded gate and the panicked escape of the rebellion leaders. Headbands, tomahawks and peace pipes (calumets) of the North American Dakotas come from the collections of Vojta N\xE1prstek, i.e. from the museum's oldest collections.

    detail: "The exhibition Around the World in 80 Days revisits the work of the French writer Jules Verne (1828\u20131905). Jules Verne has been well known in the Czech cultural environment since the 19th century and his books are popular and published to this day. Although Jules Verne is regarded as one of the founders of the science fiction genre, novels with this theme form only part of his extensive oeuvre. In his time, he became famous mainly for his social novels. The 1873 novel Around the World in 80 Days, which also provided the name to the entire exhibition, is not a science fiction novel, either. Its main motif is the foolish wager of an English gentleman, invented as if in passing while debating over a newspaper in a London club. In the subsequent journey around the world, which must be accomplished in a specific time, technology, although historical, plays a key role. The visitor of the exhibition follows the fictional characters of Verne\u2019s novel on their journey around the world and, through collection objects, photographic and graphic reproductions, infographics and texts, learns about the real places where the novel takes place, in a historical context. The opening section presents the society of the end of the 19th century in terms of geopolitical situation and technical development, which enabled the rapid development of international transport. This is followed by individual \u201Cstops\u201D around the world \u2013 Egypt, India, Singapore, China, Japan and the United States. Each region is represented by typical traditional objects in contrast with the changes brought by modern times and the phenomena that have influenced the world since the 19th century: the development of railways and shipping, the importance of the Suez Canal, colonialism and the changing relationship with indigenous ethnic groups. A separate part of the exhibition is dedicated to the character of the writer Jules Verne and his work. There are also examples of French and Czech editions of Verne\u2019s novels, including the oldest ones. The exhibition also presents some art inspired by Jules Verne's work, whether in the form of artistic sculptures by Jaroslav R\xF3na or paper models by Ladislav Badalec. The exhibition also includes an escape room based on Verne\u2019s novel.",

    detail: "The Old Masters II exhibition a follow-up to the Old Masters permanent exhibition located in the opposite Schwarzenberg palace. Both exhibitions complement each other to form a coherent whole, while presenting magnificent artwork in different contexts. The new exhibition in the Sternberg palace follows the historical tradition of exhibiting masterpieces in this building, which was used in 1811\u2060\u2013\u20601871 as a seat of the Society of Patriotic Friends of the Arts, the predecessor of today\u2019s National Gallery Prague. This time, artwork will be exhibited in the context of centres of art and their mutual connections. Old Masters II represent the best of the unique collections of NGP and its partners \u2060\u2013\u2060 e.g. a rare collection of Russian Christian icons preserved in Prague, presenting an extraordinary personality of their collector, Nikodim P. Kondakov. The exhibition also shows a unique collection of Italian paintings of the 14th and 15th centuries gathered mostly by Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. It is the largest collection of the co-called Italian primitive school preserved outside of Italy and it explores artistic creations in Italian cities of Siena, Florence, Venice or Padua. The collection of early Italian art is complemented by Renaissance and Baroque paintings (Alessandro Allori, Jacopo Bassano, Luca Giordano). There are also extraordinary collections of Dutch and Flemish painting of the 15th to 18th centuries with the main focus on the art of Antwerp, Amsterdam, Utrecht and Leyden (Herri met de Bles, Pieter II. Brueghel, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Rachel Ruysch, Gerard Ter Borch, Nicolaes Eliasz. Pickenoy). The altar with The Crucifixion by Hans Raphon is a rare piece. It is the only fully preserved retable of the Passion of the Christ in public collections in the Czech Republic. Central European works of art are represented by the collection of Nuremberg art and selected solitary works from the territory of today\u2019s Germany, in particular from the important trading and artistic region of Rhineland dating back to the 15th to 18th centuries (Hans Baldung Grien, Hans D\xFCrer). The exhibition also displays works of art of German and Austrian lands created in the 17th and 18th centuries (Georg Flegel, Paul Troger, Johann Carl Loth, Johann Michael Rottmayr). A smaller collection of French and Spanish art of the 17th and 18th centuries is remarkable for the significance and quality of exhibited solitary pieces (Charles Mellin, Pierre Mignard, Bartolom\xE9 Esteban Murillo).

Based on the collections of the National Gallery Prague, complemented with loans from institutions and private collections, the exhibition introduces the rich and cosmopolitan art scene in the young independent Czechoslovakia between 1918 and 1938. The new exhibition of the National Gallery\u2019s collections presents rich artistic activities of the young state in 1918\u2060\u2013\u20601938. Besides the paintings by prominent Czech, Slovak, Czech-German and Carpathian-Russian artists (V\xE1clav \u0160p\xE1la, Josef \u010Capek, Jind\u0159ich \u0160tyrsk\xFD, Toyen etc.), are also shown the artworks from the National Gallery\u2019s French collection (by Claude Monet, Paul Gauguin, Henri Rousseau, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh and others). The exhibition is interdisciplinary, presenting not only visual artworks but also other cultural forms that flourished during the first republic, such as book illustrations, design, graphic design, etc. Using art topography, it shows the diversity of the art production and the lively cultural scene of the period. The exhibition presents the art of the first republic through the eyes of a 1920s and 1930s art goer and introduces prominent galleries, art clubs and institutions, as well as the important cultural centres of the young state. It primarily concentrates on Prague as an art centre with lively exhibition activity that focused not only on local artists but also on the most progressive names from all around Europe. However, the exhibition also addresses other centres such as Brno, Zl\xEDn, Bratislava, Ko\u0161ice and Uzhgorod. The curators partly reconstruct important exhibitions that were held in these centres during the first republic period (the exhibition of the Tvrdo\u0161\xEDjn\xED group, the Exhibition of Contemporary Culture in Brno, Poesie 32, the First Exhibition of Surrealists in Czechoslovakia). The exhibition introduces important cultural events of the period and emphasizes the first republic's cosmopolitan and multinational character. This approach aims not only to show with historical accuracy how wealthy and diverse the culture of the young state was but also offer inspiration for the present where the lack of historical knowledge often results in xenophobic attitudes.

    detail: "The exhibition 1796\u2060\u2013\u20601918: Art of the Long Century purposefully and naturally connects Czech and international art. Unlike the preceding permanent exhibitions at the National Gallery Prague, the artworks on display do not include any loans from other museums and galleries filling the gaps in the collections. The project does not seek to present another art historical review and re-codify key artworks produced in the Czech Lands in the 19th century. Such approach necessarily neglects the works, which were purchased for or donated to the National Gallery Prague from other European regions and also had a major influence on the local situation and development on the art scene. Instead, the exhibition shows what the National Gallery Prague has amassed in the course of its more than 220-year-long history in the broad context. Therefore, the artists are naturally represented in an uneven manner \u2060\u2013\u2060 with compact and representative sets on one hand, and more or less haphazardly acquired or occasional acquisitions on the other. The resulting selection shows more than 450 artworks by 150 artists in three major chapters: Man, The World and Ideas. The exhibition presents painting as well as sculpture. Free sculpture is accompanied by paintings. Public sculpture forms a separate section paraphrasing three basic themes in the sections of Architecture, Monument and Tombstone with respect to a selected approach and availability of the exhibits. Therefore, the artists of different art opinions and very different generations can be seen at the exhibition side by side, such as Josef M\xE1nes next to Pablo Picasso, Josef Navr\xE1til next to Bohumil Kubi\u0161ta or Antonio Canova next to Franz von Stuck. The exhibition\u2019s thematic division made it possible to subdivide it into many small subgroups of artworks representing independent sections ranging from self-portraits, family and official portraits to paintings of caf\xE9s, lively city boulevards, spring landscapes, mountain lakes or artworks with religious or mythological themes. There are two exhibitions creatively working with the 19th-century visual media, which depart from the plan to present only the artworks from the NGP collections. While the exhibition architect Ji\u0159\xED P\u0159\xEDhoda used the film material supplied by the National Gallery Prague in his three-channel projection, the designers\u2019 team of the graphic Studio Najbrt created an impressive collage of posters loaned by the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague, the National Theatre Archives and the Military History Institute Prague. The two genuinely contemporary interventions are based on the exhibition\u2019s fundamental idea \u2060\u2013\u2060 to outline the world of 19th-century man. They became the project\u2019s integral part and evidence of the inspirational character of the artistic legacy of the long century for the 21st-century society. The exhibition 1796\u2060\u2013\u20601918: Art of the Long Century from the NGP collections understands the so-called \u201Clong century\u201D in a different way than usual. The difference lies in the dates \u2060\u2013\u2060 its beginning is not linked with the events of the French Revolution, but with the birth of the Society of the Patriotic Friends of the Arts on February 5, 1796 in Prague, whose activities were of major importance for the development of fine arts in the Czech Lands. It was the year when the first public premises acquainting the visitors with major artworks of local and European art were opened. The Society of the Patriotic Friends of the Arts\u2019 another significant undertaking was the establishment of the Academy of Fine Arts three years later. Prague thus became a place, which could appear on the art map more often in the following decades as a city that responded in an increasingly dynamic way to new stimuli from abroad. The central European region acquired another major cultural centre. It was the collection of the Picture Gallery of the Society of the Patriotic Friends of the Arts that became a core of the collections of today\u2019s National Gallery Prague. In 1902, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria founded the Modern Gallery, whose acquisitions were of key importance for the rich and variegated character of the art collection in the first half of the 20th century. The purchase of the French art collection by the Czechoslovak state in 1923 was also a major undertaking. The period under examination actually covers three centuries, including the last one. The contemporary relationship to the 19th-century history, however, is often ambivalent \u2060\u2013\u2060 close as well as detached. The society and culture, including art, of that time went through significant changes, which often have a major impact on the present, too. On the other hand, 19th-century man would not understand today\u2019s compelling and pointed debates on gender or environmental problems. Yet, there are questions that the long century society has come up with. That is why there are attempts today to see art history or \u201Cread\u201D the art of the past in a different way. All of this is characterized by a certain departure from the traditional national artistic and art historical schools. In this respect, we find ourselves in the midst of an unusually fruitful and inspirational debate facilitating a radical change in the telling of the \u201Cstory of arts\u201D. The exhibition includes two small graphic cabinets presenting the rich exhibits of the Collection of Prints and Drawings from the period under examination.",

    detail: "The National Museum of Korea (Director-General: YOON Sung Yong) has recently established the Mesopotamian Gallery within its Permanent Exhibition Hall and is presenting an exhibition entitled Mesopotamia: Great Cultural Innovations, Selections from The Metropolitan Museum of Art. This marks the first exhibition on Mesopotamian civilization to be hosted by a national museum in Korea. As the first long-term exhibition in Korea to showcase Mesopotamian cultural heritage, the exhibition was co-organized with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the United States, which possesses a world-class collection of Mesopotamian artifacts. The exhibition will run for a year and a half, from July 22, 2022 to January 28, 2024. Mesopotamia: Great Cultural Innovations, Selections from The Metropolitan Museum of Art is the third special themed exhibition to be presented at the National Museum of Korea following the Egypt Gallery, which was in operation from 2019 to 2022, and the World Ceramics Gallery, which has been in operation since 2021. The new Mesopotamian Gallery was established in accordance with the museum\u2019s annual management plan for its World Art Gallery to provide visitors with opportunities to explore cultures around the world in its Permanent Exhibition Hall. Mesopotamia was the first civilization in human history to develop and apply a form of writing, which it used to pass down its accomplishments in philosophy and science to later generations. It provided a foundation for the development of human civilization and created a lasting impact, even on the contemporary world. However, it has not been subjected to the same level of attention as some other ancient civilizations, such as in Egypt, so its achievements have been less well-known. In this light, the exhibition introduces the major achievements of Mesopotamian civilization with a focus on script, seals, religion, and portraiture so that visitors can enjoy the exhibition without professional background knowledge. The exhibition is comprised of three sections. The first, entitled \u201CCultural Innovation,\u201D begins with the birth of cities. It presents a seal and a bowl that hint at Mesopotamia\u2019s development of a hierarchical society headed by priests and government officials as labor became divided and goods were collected and redistributed through the temples. The invention of cuneiform writing was a definitive cultural innovation of the Mesopotamian people. The script was used to record details of trade and business transactions, develop abstract concepts, and systematically organize knowledge of the surrounding world. Cylindrical seals were also invented around the same time. The exhibition presents thirteen clay cuneiform tablets and eleven seals. In order to vividly convey the joys and sorrows of the ancient Mesopotamians that were densely recorded on these small clay tablets, a kiosk providing interpretations and explanations of each tablet has been installed. Also introduced in this section are the major deities, temple architecture, and ritual practices of the Mesopotamian world as represented by ritual items and images of gods. Constructing huge temples and the diverse artworks inside them was also a part of the cultural innovations of the Mesopotamians. The second section, entitled \u201CArt and Identity,\u201D presents various works expressing individual identity. The abovementioned seals were carved with designs of the particular god worshipped by the seal owner along with inscriptions as a means to indicate identity. The accessories excavated from the Royal Tombs of Ur demonstrate how they were crafted with a careful selection of forms and materials, including imported materials of high value, in order to reflect the social status of the wearer or provide the deceased with strength upon reaching the underworld. Mesopotamian figurative sculptures are highly similar in appearance because their creators did not attempt to document individual characteristics but rather combined ideal attributes considered suitable to the status and achievements of the subject when creating human statues. The statues of the rulers Gudea and Ur-Namma have inscriptions carved into the body revealing whose likeness it is, demonstrating the complementary relationship between text and image. The Cuneiform Cylinder with Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II demonstrates that written records of the military and religious achievements of a ruler were as important as portraiture. The third section, entitled \u201CThe Age of Empires,\u201D presents art from the two major Mesopotamian empires, the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911\u2013612 BCE) and the Neo-Babylonian Empire (626\u2013539 BCE). These two empires that emerged in the latter half of Mesopotamian civilization left a significant legacy as much from their artistic endeavors as their wars of conquest or advanced governance. The Neo-Assyrian Empire was renowned for the beautiful stone relief scultures adorning the interior of the palace. Among them, Foreign Groom in a Tributary Procession captures a scene from the time using sophisticated carving techniques, while others such as Assyrian Soldier Conducting Captives across the Water reveal the belief of the people of the time in sculpture\u2019s power to represent reality. The Neo-Babylonian Empire took the region\u2019s millennial brick-making tradition to a higher level in the construction of buildings in the capital city of Babylon that were marvels of the world at the time. Two Panels with Striding Lions that lined the Processional Way from the Ishtar Gate, the best-known architecture of ancient Mesopotamia, are displayed in this section. The exhibition ends with a display of decorative bricks that remind visitors how simple yet versatile bricks provided the foundation for all the achievements of Mesopotamian civilization. The exhibition presents four videos that facilitate visitors\u2019 understanding of the exhibits. In the first section is a video demonstrating how to make a modern impression of a cylinder seal (with one of the seals on display) and another about the seal with a detailed explanation provided by a Met curator. The second section features a video of stories about the Mesopotamian civilization shared by Dr. Kim Benzel, Curator in Charge of the Ancient Near Eastern Art Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which loaned the exhibits. In the video room, a huge cube-screen video on the worldview of Mesopotamian civilization and its artistic achievements welcomes visitors. The Mesopotamian people diligently recorded their stories in great detail on palm-sized clay tablets. Their stories are highly detailed and surprisingly similar to those of the people of the present and therefore easy to identify with despite the thousands of intervening years. At the end of the cube video are QR codes that leads to a story of joys and sorrows connecting visitors with a far distant fellow human. This exhibition presenting the cultural heritage of ancient Mesopotamia, which can be difficult to encounter in person not only in Korea but anywhere in the world, will provide an opportunity to explore the cultural innovations, advanced technology, and profound thoughts left behind by the people of the Mesopotamian world, which established itself as a defining point in human history. Admission to the exhibition is free of charge.",

    detail: "The Astana tombs (\u963F\u65AF\u5854\u90A3\u53E4\u58B3) are located 35 kilometers southeast of Turpan City in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, close to the ruins of the ancient city of Gaochang (\u9AD8\u660C\u6545\u57CE). These tombs were constructed as a cemetery for the ruling class starting around the 3rd century and continuing through the late 8th century. Over 400 tombs have been discovered to date. The early 20th century expeditions headed by the Western powers to the Silk Road and numerous excavations conducted by the Xinjiang Museum in China since 1959 led to a discovery of a wide variety of tomb furnishings in very good condition, including paintings of Fuxi and N\xFCwa, figurines, pottery, and documents. This exhibition aims to present the research results on 85 artifacts excavated from the Astana tombs that had been collected by the Otani (\u5927\u8C37) expedition in the early 20th century and currently housed at the National Museum of Korea. The pottery vessels and wooden trays used as funerary objects were identified as a set based on the data available at the time of their acquisition. A figurine of warrior riding a horse has been restored by rejoining fragments. The methods used in its production have been analyzed through a CT scan. The displayed objects arranged according to the layout of a tomb well demonstrate the characteristics of Astana tombs built and adorned as a home for eternity. we hope that this exhibition will provide an opportunity to appreciate and better understand the wishes of the people of the time for a sustained life after death.",

    detail: "Imagine a day when a large-scale Buddhist hanging scroll (gwaebul in Korean) was being hung outside the main hall at the thousand-year-old Sudeoksa Temple in Yesan, Chungcheongnam-do Province. In front of the main hall, small painted banners that mark the sacred space where the gwaebul hangs are fluttering in the wind. A wide array of offerings are piled up in front of the hall. Brilliant warm sunlight and gentle breezes sooth the hearts of the people who are waiting for the Buddha they hope soon to encounter. The temple yard reverberates with the chanting of monks\u2019 chanting and seems to swirl with the people\u2019s dearest wishes. The colossal hanging scroll filled with colorful lights unfolds as the colorful cloths tied to the top of the painting cross the blue sky over the main hall. To celebrate Buddha\u2019s Birthday in 2022, the National Museum of Korea is holding its seventeenth gwaebul exhibition, entitled Feast of Light: Buddhist Hanging Scroll at Sudeoksa Temple in Yesan. The exhibition offers a rare opportunity to personally view a gwaebul painting normally stored away at a temple. Facing such a large Buddhist hanging scroll, viewers often experience an inexplicable but intense thrill, even if they are not familiar with Buddhist thinking and doctrine. Although this painting was produced several hundred years ago, the Buddhist world portrayed in the painting still moves viewers\u2019 minds the way it did back then. This exhibition is the first time the gwaebul painting of Sudeoksa Temple in Yesan is being presented together with another treasure of the temple, a lotus pedestal from the Goryeo Dynasty. The lotus pedestal adorned with beautiful designs demonstrates the splendid Buddhist culture of the Goryeo Dynasty. We would like to invite visitors to appreciate the beauty of cultural properties transported from Sudeoksa Temple to the National Museum of Korea.",

    detail: "Buddhist arts in Japan has evolved into a wide variety of forms since the sixth century. In the early years of its development, sculptures were produced under the direct influence of models from China and Korea. However, by the ninth century (during the Heian period), a distinctive Buddhist culture had begun to develop in Japan. In particular, Esoteric Buddhism centering around Mahavairocana Buddha and Pure Land Buddhism revolving around Amitabha Buddha flourished. Moreover, the syncretism of Buddhism and Shintoism, the indigenous religious beliefs of Japan, provides a distinct facet to Japanese Buddhist culture unique compared to Chinese and Korean versions. This exhibition presents Buddhist sculptures embodying the three prominent features of Japanese Buddhist faith: the flourishing of Esoteric Buddhism and Pure Land Buddhism and the syncretism between Buddhist and Shinto beliefs. Those sculptures are in the collection of Tokyo National Museum. It is an outcome of the ongoing exchanges and partnership taking place between National Museum of Korea and Tokyo National Museum.",

Exploring ways in which change of physical boundaries penetrates everyday sensual experiences, she traces the scenes, moments, and voices of the people excluded from our contemporary sense of speed. Presented on the media wall in Leeum\u2019s lobby, \u201CSojung Jun: Green Screen\u201D is composed of three of her works related to the experience and imaginary of borders: Green Screen (2021), Eclipse (2020), and Early Arrival of Future (2015). Considering the media wall\u2019s unusual location in a lobby connecting the museum\u2019s various spaces and serving as an arcade for temporary gatherings, Jun conceived of the program by approaching the media wall as a medium as well as a device. A rather vulnerable space for exhibition, the media wall offered her a device for managing time and maximizing senses \u2013 something similar to such fictional spaces located in reality as \u201Cportals, wormholes, chukjibeop  (a hypothetical method of folding space and shrinking distance), and time travel to the fourth dimension,\u201D as the artist puts it. This view corresponds to how she perceives Korea\u2019s Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) as a twilight zone full of potentials in Green Screen, which unfolds green sceneries of the DMZ, thus providing a ground for the one-time monumental collaboration. The superimposition of the three works\u2014Early Arrival of Future which summons a future into the present, Green Screen which creates ruptures in reality and perception, and Eclipse which translates our imagining the border as a sliding image\u2014is to temporarily construct non-linear space and time. Fictional realities thus created will rattle our sense of borders and create fractures.",

The series is dedicated to presenting works by artists in their 20s and 30s, in the lounge area located in the museum lobby.Jiyoung Yoo: Closed Containers is the first exhibition of ROOM Project. Jiyoung Yoo questions and restructures the established conditions and components of painting. One could say that a painting is a container of images, which are drawn on a support\u2013most commonly a cloth stretched over a grid of wooden stretcher bars, a wooden panel, or a piece of paper. In order to break away from the conventional system of painting, Yoo substitutes the structure of painting with those of everyday objects, for example a calendar or squared manuscript papers. She continues to explore the relationship between the support and images, more recently through works that borrow the forms of cupboards and shelves found in households.In Closed Containers, Yoo ponders upon objects in museums. Leeum\u2019s galleries for traditional Korean art display many types of containers such as bottles, ewers, cases, dishes, and water droppers. These objects are empty but \u201Cclosed\u201D containers for they are no longer functional, with their original purposes only indicated by the labels. Yoo has taken this contradictory nature of the museum objects as the motif of the works in the exhibition.A Pile of Grid and Piles of Grid are cupboards that cannot be opened; Pigeonhole a drawer that cannot store things; and Door a door that is forever closed. These non-functional objects allude to the constant tension between the museum objects and visitors who are prohibited from interacting with the objects. The empty, closed containers, on the other hand, are open to visitors\u2019 boundless imagination of what could be stored in them. A Compartment of Time and Compartments of Currents are works that divide the infinite flow of time and water into one piece of painting, and many pieces of wallpaper, respectively. The two works symbolize the centuries of time that are deposited and the endless possibilities of what will be added in the closed containers. The exhibition culminates with the message conveyed by the letters that replace numbers on the faces of five clocks: container unfolds what you desire.",

    detail: "This exhibition is designed as a form of a performance that reconstructs the reality that we are in now, bringing the questions inherent in Choe-Uram's well-known works to the forefront. The situation in which humanity's survival is threatened by an unprecedented crisis has provided an opportunity to re-examine and question things that have long been taken for granted. The escalation of anxiety and polarization caused by climate change and socio-political and economic crises clearly reveals the real portrait of an era of disorientation. In response, the artist constructed the exhibition with the \u2018Ark\u2019 as the main theme and juxtaposed the contradictory desires that constitute the contemporary era, providing a place for the audience to ponder and raise questions about where we are ultimately destined. The black colored Round Table placed in the center of the Seoul Box is supported by 18 headless figures made from straw, and a round head placed on top of the table rolls around intermittently. This is a comparison to the fierce competition to occupy the single head, and the structure where it is impossible to escape from this struggle even if there is no desire for the head. Hovering above are three Black Birds, constructed of pieces cut from recycled cardboard boxes. They rotate slowly around the high ceiling and watch over the struggle taking place below. Who will get hold of the head? Who will be the loser? Who will be able to escape this strife? Little Ark is a symbolic ark made of heavy iron and recycled cardboard boxes with cutting-edge technology. Where do we stand in this era where the exploration of outer space is accelerating, while simultaneously aggravating the crisis of the Earth's ecosystem? Thirty-five pairs of oars stand erected like a wall that alienates us, then begin a majestic dance as if spreading wings. Lighthouse placed on top of the ship, Two Captains and James Webb facing opposite directions, Angel with a feebly slouching body, Anchor that makes it difficult to tell if the ark is docked or sailing, and Infinite Space which is a metaphor to mankind endlessly chasing desires even in a time of crisis; these works all maximize the ambivalent reality alongside Little Ark while drawing our eyes to Exit. This video, in which a door opens but then a closed door repeatedly emerges, is in harmony with the ambient sound that fills the exhibition space, inviting us to delve into our desires, reflect on the present, and raise many questions. What is the purpose of this voyage? Where is the destination? Is there really an exit? Where is the end to this desire? However, in one corner of the exhibition space, Red repeatedly blooms and withers while emitting fierce red light. If One, a large white flower at the entrance of Gallery 5, is a commemorative wreath made by the artist for the pain of his contemporaries who have experienced the recent pandemic, Red signifies how we must endeavor to move forward nonetheless, as well as the cycle of life itself. In order to truly navigate one's own voyage, one must constantly question and seek answers in pursuit of invisible fundamental values, rather than following the absolute or the desires of others. As the drawings that are the basis of Choe's works suggest, important things cannot always be seen by the eye, and the true meaning of existence is not easily revealed. While walking through the brightly lit corridors, we hope the audience will navigate their own individual universes along with URC-1 and URC-2, which were reborn as stars by assembling the headlights and taillights of scrapped cars.",

    detail: "The MMCA Performing Arts 2022: Museum-Carbon-Project is a reflective program in the form of a series of multidisciplinary events, all of which question how we should respond to climate change in the Anthropocene. Until now, we have only evaluated an exhibition based on its aesthetic achievements, its impact on the ecology of art, the number of visitors, and the level of visitors' satisfaction. We have neglected the environmental effects created in the course of putting together an exhibition. Climate change caused by greenhouse gasses looms as an ever-growing problem all across the world, meaning we can no longer overlook the environmental consequences of creating an exhibition. Given this reality, what are the perspectives and attitudes we must adopt to face this problem? What must our judgment criteria entail and how can we transform our concerns into discourse? \uFFA0 Issues of climate change or carbon emissions are by no means a simple problem that can be easily solved. Although the Anthropocene, climate change, and carbon emissions are real phenomena that we can no longer ignore, they are also \u201Chyperobjects\u201D that are too large and convoluted to be grasped as a whole; they are, in essence, parts of a complex problem that concern the entire human race. That is why the MMCA Performing Arts 2022: Museum-Carbon-Project program does not simply aim to reduce the quantitative amount of carbon emissions at the museum. Rather, this project suggests we see climate change and carbon emission as a process of addressing problems about the human community and expanding the ways we sense the present time. \uFFA0 As a start, the MMCA Performing Arts 2022: Museum-Carbon-Project calculates the amount of carbon emitted at every step of creating an exhibition at the MMCA. A wide range of \u201CProjects\u201D* in the form of presentations, discussions, and workshops have been developed, each dealing with different activities involved in exhibition-making. Meanwhile, \u201CDiscussions\u201D** will take place forming an arena where people from different disciplines can come together to share their concerns. The MMCA Performing Arts 2022: Museum-Carbon-Project program will not act as a vehicle to generate schematic outcomes, but instead be used as an arena of contemplation that questions and examines what role museums should play in the Anthropocene, while also serving as a preliminary preparation for sustainable exhibition-making in the future. \uFFA0 *From August 19 to October 30, 2022 a wide range of \u201CProjects\u201D will be carried out, each derived and developed from different activities involved in exhibition-making, including the production of artworks, employee commuting and business trips, packaging and transportation of artworks, construction of exhibition spaces, production of PR materials, energy use in exhibition spaces, transportation of visitors, and the disposal of exhibition waste. **The \u201CDiscussions\u201D related to the exhibition-making activities will be consistently updated on the MMCA website. For instance, materials such as the current status of MMCA, existing guidelines, issues, and proposals will be put together and shared on the website, as well as through a separate sourcebook.",

    detail: "MMCA Lee Kun-hee Collection: LEE JUNG SEOP exhibits a selection of roughly 100 pieces; putting together 90 works by Lee Jungseop among the 1,488 pieces donated by the late Lee Kun-hee, president of Samsung group in April 2021, and 10 works by Lee Jungseop from the MMCA collection. This is the second exhibition focusing on the Lee Kun-hee collection, as well as a collection exhibition prepared to display superior Korean art pieces, and to provide the visitors an opportunity to see artworks high in scarcity value. Lee Jungseop (1916-1956) was an honest painter, who did not let go of his passion for paintings even when his life was harsh and difficult. As a civic painter that drew \u2018bull\u2019 paintings since the Japanese colonial period, he can be referred to as a national artist. Since 1970s, movies, theater plays, novels about Lee Jungseop were produced and he was loved by the public for a long time. MMCA Lee Kun-hee Collection: LEE JUNG SEOP is an attempt to look at Lee Jungseop in another way through the MMCA collections, unraveling the artwork collection and research function of a public museum into an exhibition. This exhibition consists of two parts: first, pencil drawings and postcard paintings made in Wonsan and Japan in 1940s. Second, prime artworks and tinfoil paintings created in Tongyeong, Seoul, and Daegu in 1950s. This exhibition aims to evenly reflect artist Lee Jungseop and human Lee Jungseop, and to display the various sides of Lee Jungseop. We hope that the life and works of artist Lee Jungseop, who drew ideals while going through shabby reality, reaches many more people through the Lee Kun-hee collection, and further on, give an opportunity to increase the understanding and usage of collections.",
